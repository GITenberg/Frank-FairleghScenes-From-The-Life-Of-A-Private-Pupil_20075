<h2>
    CHAPTER I &mdash; ALL RIGHT! OFF WE GO!
</h2>

    <span class="pagenum">[1]</span>      

<pre>
          "Yet here... you are stayed for
          ... There; my blessing with you,
          And these few precepts in thy memory
          See thou character&mdash;&mdash;-"

          "Home-keeping youth have ever homely wits.
          I rather would entreat thy company
          To see the wonders of the world abroad,
          Than living dully, sluggardis'd at home,
          Wear out thy youth with shapeless idleness."

          "Where unbruised youth, with unstuff'd brain,
          Doth couch his limbs, there golden sleep doth reign."
          <i>Shakspeare</i>
</pre>
<p>
"NEVER forget, under any circumstances, to think and act like a
gentleman, and don't exceed your allowance," said my father.
</p>
<p>
"Mind you read your Bible, and remember what I told you about wearing
flannel waistcoats," cried my mother.
</p>
<p>
And with their united "God bless you, my boy!" still ringing in my ears,
I found myself inside the stage-coach, on my way to London.
</p>
<p>
Now, I am well aware that the correct thing for a boy in my situation
(i.e. leaving home for the first time) would be to fall back on his
seat, and into a reverie, during which, utterly lost to all external
impressions, he should entertain the thoughts and feelings of a
well-informed man of thirty; the same thoughts and feelings being
clothed in <span class="pagenum">[2]</span>the semi-poetic prose of a fashionable novel-writer.
Deeply grieved, therefore, am I at being forced both to set at nought so
laudable an established precedent, and to expose my own degeneracy. But
the truth must be told at all hazards. The only feeling I experienced,
beyond a vague sense of loneliness and desolation, was one of great
personal discomfort. It rained hard, so that a small stream of water,
which descended from the roof of the coach as I entered it, had
insinuated itself between one of the flannel waistcoats, which formed
so important an item in the maternal valediction, and my skin, whence,
endeavouring to carry out what a logician would call the "law of its
being," by finding its own level, it placed me in the undesirable
position of an involuntary disciple of the cold-water cure taking a
"sitz-bad". As to my thoughts, the reader shall have the full benefit
of them, in the exact order in which they flitted through my brain.
</p>
<p>
First came a vague desire to render my position more comfortable, ending
in a forlorn hope that intense and continued sitting might, by some
undefined process of evaporation, cure the evil. This suggested a
speculation, half pleasing and half painful, as to what would be
my mother's feelings could she be aware of the state of things; the
pleasure being the result of that mysterious preternatural delight which
a boy always takes in everything at all likely to injure his health,
or endanger his existence, and the pain arising from the knowledge that
there was now no one near me to care whether I was comfortable or not.
Again, these speculations merged into a sort of dreamy wonder, as to
why a queer little old gentleman opposite (my sole fellow-traveller) was
grunting like a pig, at intervals of about a minute, though he was wide
awake the whole time; and whether a small tuft of hair, on a mole at
the tip of his nose, could have anything to do with it. At this point my
meditations were interrupted by the old gentleman himself, who, after
a louder grunt than usual, gave vent to his feelings in the following
speech, which was partly addressed to me and partly a soliloquy.
</p>
<p>
"Umph! going to school, my boy, eh?" then, in a lower tone, "Wonder why
I called him my boy, when he's no such thing: just like me, umph!"
</p>
<p>
I replied by informing him that I was not exactly going to school&mdash;(I
was nearly fifteen, and the word "school" sounded derogatory to my
dignity)&mdash;but that, having been up to the present time educated at home
by my father, I was now on my way to complete my studies under the care
of a private tutor, who only received six pupils, a very different thing
from a school, as I took the liberty of insinuating.
</p>
<p>
"Umph! different thing? You will cost more, learn less, and fancy
yourself a man when you are a boy; that's the only difference I can
see:" then came the aside&mdash;"Snubbing the poor child, when he's a peg too
low already, just like me; umph!"
</p>
<p>
After which he relapsed into a silence which continued uninterrupted
until we reached London, save once, while we were changing horses, when
he produced a flask with a silver top, and, taking a sip himself, asked
me if I drank brandy. On my shaking my head, with a smile caused by
what appeared to me the utter wildness and desperation of the notion, he
muttered:&mdash;
</p>
<p>
"Umph! of course he doesn't; how should he?&mdash;just like me".
</p>
<p>
In due course of time we reached the Old Bell Inn, Holborn, where the
coach stopped, and where my trunk and myself were to be handed over to
the tender mercies of the coachman of the Rocket, a fast coach (I speak
of the slow old days when railroads were unknown) which then ran to
Helmstone, the watering-place where my future tutor, the Rev. Dr.
Mildman, resided. My first impressions of London are scarcely worth
recording, for the simple reason that they consisted solely of intense
and unmitigated surprise at everything and everybody I saw and
heard; which may be more readily believed when I add the fact that my
preconceived notions of the metropolis had led me to imagine it perhaps
might be twice the size of the town nearest to my father's house; in
short, almost as large as Grosvenor Square.
</p>
<p>
Here, then, I parted company with my fellow-traveller, who took leave of
me thus:&mdash;
</p>
<p>
"Umph! well, good-bye; be a good boy&mdash;good man, you'd like me to say,
I suppose; man, indeed! umph! don't forget what your parents told you";
then adding, "Of course he will, what's the use of telling him not?
just like me";&mdash;he dived into the recesses of a hackney-coach, and
disappeared.
</p>
<p>
Nothing worthy of note occurred during my journey to Helmstone, where
we arrived at about half-past four in the afternoon. My feelings of
surprise and admiration were destined once more to be excited on this
(to me) memorable day, as, in my way from the coach-office to Langdale
Terrace, where Dr. Mildman resided, I beheld, for the first time, that
most stupendous work of God, the mighty Ocean; which, alike in its wild
resistless freedom, and its <span class="pagenum">[4]</span>miraculous obedience to the command,
"Thus far shalt thou come, and no further," bears at once the plainest
print of its Almighty Creator's hand, while it affords a strong and
convincing proof of His omnipotence.
</p>
<p>
On knocking at the door of Dr. Mildman's house (if the truth must
be told, it was with a trembling hand I did so) it was opened by a
man-servant, whose singularly plain features were characterised by
an expression alternating between extreme civility and an intense
appreciation of the ludicrous.
</p>
<p>
On mentioning my name, and asking if Dr. Mildman was at home, he
replied:&mdash;
</p>
<p>
"Yes, sir, master's in, sir; so you're Mr. Fairlegh, sir, our new young
gent, sir?" (here the ludicrous expression predominated); "hope you'll
be comfortable, sir" (here he nearly burst into a laugh); "show you into
master's study, sir, directly" (here he became preternaturally grave
again); and, opening the study door, ushered me into the presence of the
dreaded tutor.
</p>
<p>
On my entrance Dr. Mildman (for such I presumed a middle-aged gentleman,
the sole tenant of the apartment, to be) rose from a library table, at
which he had been seated, and, shaking me kindly by the hand, inquired
after the health of my father and mother, what sort of journey I had
had, and sundry other particulars of the like nature, evidently with the
good-humoured design of putting me a little more at my ease, as I
have no doubt the trepidation I was well aware of feeling inwardly, at
finding myself <i>tête-à-tête</i> with a real live tutor, was written in very
legible characters on my countenance. Dr. Mildman, whose appearance
I studied with an anxious eye, was a gentlemanly-looking man of
five-and-forty, or thereabouts, with a high bald forehead, and good
features, the prevailing expression of which, naturally mild and
benevolent, was at times chequered by that look which all schoolmasters
sooner or later acquire-a look which seems to say, "Now, sir, do you
intend to mind me or do you not?" Had it not been for this, and for
an appearance of irresolution about the mouth, he would have been a
decidedly fine-looking man. While I was making these observations he
informed me that I had arrived just in time for dinner, and that the
servant should show me to my sleeping apartment, whence, when I had
sacrificed to the Graces (as he was pleased to call dressing), I was to
descend to the drawing-room, and be introduced to Mrs. Mildman and my
future companions.
</p>
<p>
My sleeping-room, which was rather a small garret than otherwise, was
furnished, as it appeared to me, with more <span class="pagenum">[5]</span>regard to economy than to
the comfort of its inmate. At one end stood a small four-post bedstead,
which, owing to some mysterious cause, chose to hold its near fore-leg
up in the air, and slightly advanced, thereby impressing the beholder
with the idea that it was about to trot into the middle of the room. On
an unpainted deal table stood a looking-glass, which, from a habit it
had of altering and embellishing the face of any one who consulted it,
must evidently have possessed a strong natural taste for the ludicrous:
an ancient washing-stand, supporting a basin and towel, and a
dissipated-looking chair completed the catalogue.
</p>
<p>
And here, while preparing for the alarming ordeal I was so soon to
undergo, let me present to the reader a slight sketch of myself, mental
and bodily; and, as mind ought to take precedence of matter, I will
attempt, as far as I am able after the lapse of time, to paint my
character in true colours, "nought extenuating, nor setting down aught
in malice". I was, then, as the phrase goes, "a very well-behaved young
gentleman"; that is, I had a great respect for all properly constituted
authorities, and an extreme regard for the proprieties of life; was very
particular about my shoes being clean, and my hat nicely brushed; always
said "Thank you" when a servant handed me a plate, and "May I trouble
you?" when I asked for a bit of bread. In short, I bade fair in time to
become a thorough old bachelor; one of those unhappy mortals whose lives
are alike a burthen to themselves and others-men who, by magnifying
the minor household miseries into events of importance, are uneasy and
suspicious about the things from the wash having been properly aired,
and become low and anxious as the dreadful time approaches when clean
sheets are inevitable! My ideas of a private tutor, derived chiefly from
<i>Sandford and Merton</i>, and <i>Evenings at Home</i>, were rather wide of the
mark, leading me to expect that Dr. Mildman would impart instruction
to us during long rambles over green fields, and in the form of moral
allegories, to which we should listen with respectful attention and
affectionate esteem. With regard to my outward man, or rather boy, I
should have been obliged to confine myself to such particulars as I
could remember, namely, that I was tall for my age, but slightly built,
and so thin, as often to provoke the application of such epithets as
"hop-pole," "thread-paper," etc., had it not been that, in turning over
some papers a few days since, I stumbled on a water-colour sketch of
myself, which I well remember being taken by a young artist in the
neighbourhood, just <span class="pagenum">[6]</span>before I left home, in the hope of consoling
my mother for my departure. It represented a lad about fifteen, in
a picturesque attitude, feeding a pony out of a very elegant little
basket, with what appeared to be white currants, though I have every
reason to believe they were meant for oats. The aforesaid youth rejoiced
in an open shirt-collar and black ribbon <i>à la</i> Byron, curling hair of a
dark chestnut colour, regular features, a high forehead, complexion like
a girl's, very pink and white, and a pair of large blue eyes, engaged in
regarding the white currant oats with intense surprise, as well indeed
they might. Whether this young gentleman bore more resemblance to me
than the currants did to oats, I am, of course, unable to judge; but, as
the portrait represented a very handsome boy, I hope none of my readers
will be rude enough to doubt that it was a striking likeness.
</p>
<p>
I now proceeded to render myself thoroughly wretched, by attempting to
extricate the articles necessary for a change of dress from the very
bottom of my trunk, where, according to the nature of such things, they
had hidden themselves; grammars, lexicons, and other like "Amenities of
Literature," being the things that came to hand most readily. Scarcely
had I contrived to discover a wearable suit when I was informed that
dinner was on the table; so, hastily tumbling into my clothes, and
giving a final peep at the facetious looking-glass, the result of which
was to twist the bow of my Byron tie under my left ear, in the belief
that I was thereby putting it straight, I rushed downstairs, just
in time to see the back of the hindmost pupil disappear through the
dining-room door.
</p>
<p>
"Better late than never, Fairlegh. Mrs. Mildman, this is Fairlegh;
he can sit by you, Coleman;-'For what we are going to receive,'
etc.;&mdash;Thomas, the carving-knife."
</p>
<p>
Such was the address with which my tutor greeted my entrance, and,
during its progress, I popped into a seat indicated by a sort of half
wink from Thomas, resisting by a powerful act of self-control a sudden
impulse which seized me to bolt out of the room, and do something rash
but indefinite, between going to sea and taking prussic acid; not quite
either, but partaking of the nature of both. "Take soup, Fairlegh?" said
Dr. Mildman. "Thank you, sir, if you please."
</p>
<p>
"A pleasant journey, had you?" inquired Mrs. Mildman.
</p>
<p>
"Not any, I am much obliged to you," I replied, thinking of the fish.
</p>
<p>
This produced a total silence, during which the pupils <span class="pagenum">[7]</span>exchanged
glances, and Thomas concealed an illicit smile behind the bread-basket.
</p>
<p>
"Does your father," began Dr. Mildman in a very grave and deliberate
manner, "does your father shoot?&mdash;boiled mutton, my dear?"
</p>
<p>
I replied that he had given it up of late years, as the fatigue was too
much for him.
</p>
<p>
"Oh! I was very fond of carrying a gun-pepper-when I was-a spoon-at
Oxford; I could hit a-mashed potato-bird as well as most men; yes, I was
very sorry to give up my double-barrel-ale, Thomas."
</p>
<p>
"You came inside, I believe?" questioned Mrs. Mildman, a lady possessing
a shadowy outline, indistinct features faintly characterised by an
indefinite expression, long ringlets of an almost impossible shade
of whity-brown, and a complexion and general appearance only to be
described by the term "washed out".
</p>
<p>
"Yes, all the way, ma'am."
</p>
<p>
"Did you not dislike it very much? it creases one's gown so, unless it
is a merino or mousseline-de-laine; but one can't always wear them, you
know."
</p>
<p>
Not being in the least prepared with a suitable answer, I merely made
what I intended to be an affirmative ahem, in doing which a crumb of
bread chose to go the wrong way, producing a violent fit of coughing,
in the agonies of which I seized and drank off Dr. Mildman's tumbler of
ale, mistaking it for my own small beer. The effect of this, my crowning
<i>gaucherie</i>, was to call forth a languid smile on the countenance of the
senior pupil, a tall young man, with dark hair, and a rather forbidding
expression of face, which struggled only too successfully with an
attempt to look exceedingly amiable; which smile was repeated with
variations by all the others.
</p>
<p>
"I'm afraid you do not distinctly perceive the difference between those
important pronouns, <i>meum</i> and <i>tuum</i>, Fairlegh? Thomas, a clean glass!"
said Dr. Mildman, with a forced attempt at drollery; but Thomas had
evaporated suddenly, leaving no clue to his whereabouts, unless sundry
faint sounds of suppressed laughter outside the door, indicating, as I
fancied, his extreme appreciation of my unfortunate mistake, proceeded
from him.
</p>
<p>
It is, I believe, a generally received axiom that all mortal affairs
must sooner or later come to an end; at all events, the dinner I have
been describing did not form an exception to the rule. In due time Mrs.
Mildman disappeared, after which Dr. Mildman addressed a remark or two
about Greek tragedy to the tall pupil, which led to a <span class="pagenum">[8]</span>dissertation
on the merits of a gentleman named Prometheus, who, it seemed, was bound
in some peculiar way, but whether this referred to his apprenticeship to
any trade, or to the cover of the book containing his history, did not
appear. This conversation lasted about ten minutes, at the expiration of
which the senior pupil "grinned horribly a ghastly smile" at the others,
who instantly rose, and conveyed themselves out of the room with such
rapidity that I, being quite unprepared for such a proceeding, sat for a
moment in silent amazement, and then, becoming suddenly alive to a sense
of my situation, rushed frantically after them. My speed was checked
somewhat abruptly by a door at the end of the passage being violently
slammed in my face, for which polite attention I was indebted to the
philanthropy of the hindmost pupil, who thereby imposed upon me the
agreeable task of feeling in the dark for a door-handle in an unknown
locality. After fumbling for some time, in a state of the greatest
bewilderment I at length opened the door, and beheld the interior of
the "pupils' room," which, for the benefit of such of my readers as may
never have seen the like, I will now endeavour shortly to describe.
</p>
<p>
The parlour devoted to the pupils' use was of a good size, nearly
square, and, like the cabin of a certain "ould Irish gentleman,"
appeared to be fitted up with "nothing at all for show". In three of the
corners stood small tables covered with books and writing materials for
the use of Dr. Mildman and the two senior pupils; in the fourth was a
book-case. The centre of the room was occupied by a large square table,
the common property of the other pupils; while a carpet, "a little
the worse for wear," and sundry veteran chairs, rather crazy from the
treatment to which many generations of pupils had subjected them
(a chair being the favourite projectile in the event of a shindy),
completed the catalogue. Mr. Richard Cumberland, the senior pupil, was
lounging in an easy attitude on one side of the fireplace; on the
other stood, bolt upright, a lad rather older than myself, with a long
unmeaning face, and a set of arms and legs which appeared not to belong
to one another. This worthy, as I soon learned, responded to the name
of Nathaniel Mullins, and usually served as the butt of the party in the
absence of newer or worthier game. Exactly in front of the fire, with
his coat-tails under his arms, and his legs extended like a pair of
compasses, was stationed Mr. George Lawless, who, having been expelled
from one of the upper forms at Eton for some heroic exploit which the
head master could not be persuaded to <span class="pagenum">[9]</span>view in its proper light, was
sent to vegetate for a year or two at Dr. Mildman's ere he proceeded to
one of the universities. This gentleman was of rather a short thick-set
figure, with a large head, and an expression of countenance resembling
that of a bull when the animal "means mischief," and was supposed by his
friends to be more "thoroughly wide awake" than any one of his years
in the three kingdoms. The quartette was completed by Mr. Frederick
Coleman, a small lad, with a round merry face, who was perched on the
back of a chair, with his feet resting on the hob, and his person so
disposed as effectually to screen every ray of fire from Nathaniel
Mullins.
</p>
<p>
"You are not cold, Fairlegh? Don't let me keep the fire from you," said
Lawless, without, however, showing the slightest intention of moving.
"Not very, thank you."
</p>
<p>
"Eh! quite right&mdash;glad to hear it. It's Mildman's wish that, during the
first half, no pupil should come on the hearthrug. I made a point of
conscience of it myself when I first came. The Spartans, you know, never
allowed their little boys to do so, and even the Athenians, a much more
luxurious people, always had their pinafores made of asbestos, or some
such fireproof stuff. You are well read in Walker's <i>History of Greece</i>,
I hope?" I replied that I was afraid I was not. "Never read <i>Hookeyus
Magnus</i>? Your father ought to be ashamed of himself for neglecting you
so. You are aware, I suppose, that the Greeks had a different sort of
fire from what we burn nowadays? You've heard of Greek fire?"
</p>
<p>
I answered that I had, but did not exactly understand what it meant.
</p>
<p>
"Not know that, either? disgraceful! Well, it was a kind of way they
had of flaring up in those times a sort of 'light of other days,' which
enabled them to give their friends a warm reception; so much so, indeed,
that their friends found it too warm sometimes, and latterly they
usually reserved it for their enemies. Mind you remember all this, for
it is one of the first things old Sam will be sure to ask you."
</p>
<p>
Did my ears deceive me? Could he have called the tutor, the dreaded
tutor, "old Sam"? I trembled as I stood&mdash;plain, unhonoured "Sam," as
though he had spoken of a footman! The room turned round with me. Alas
for Sandford and Merton, and affectionate and respectful esteem!
</p>
<p>
"But how's this?" continued Lawless, "we have <span class="pagenum">[10]</span>forgotten to
introduce you in form to your companions, and to enter your name in the
books of the establishment; why, Cumberland, what were you thinking of?"
</p>
<p>
"Beg pardon," rejoined Cumberland, "I really was so buried in thought,
trying to solve that problem about bisecting the Siamese twins&mdash;you know
it, Lawless? However, it is not too late, is it? Allow me to introduce
you, Mr. Fairplay&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>
<p>
"Legh, sir," interrupted I.
</p>
<p>
"Ah, exactly; well, then, Mr. Fairlegh, let me introduce this gentleman,
Mr. George Lawless, who has, if I mistake not, been already trying, with
his usual benevolence, to supply a few of your deficiencies; he is,
if he will allow me to say so, one of the most rising young men of his
generation, one of the firmest props of the glorious edifice of our
rights and privileges."
</p>
<p>
"A regular brick," interposed Coleman. "Hold your tongue, Freddy: little
boys should be seen and not heard, as Tacitus tells us," said Lawless,
reprovingly.
</p>
<p>
The only reply to this, if reply it could be called, was something which
sounded to me like a muttered reference to the Greek historian Walker,
whom Lawless had so lately mentioned; and Cumberland continued:&mdash;
</p>
<p>
"You will pay great attention to everything Lawless tells you,
and endeavour to improve by following his example, at a respectful
distance&mdash;ahem! The gentleman on your right hand, Mr. Mullins, who is
chiefly remarkable for looking ['like a fool,' put in Coleman, <i>sotto
voce</i>], before he leaps, so long, that in general he postpones leaping
altogether, and is in the habit of making ['an ass of himself,'
suggested Coleman]&mdash;really, Freddy, I am surprised at you&mdash;of making two
bites at a cherry&mdash;you will be better able to appreciate when you know
more of him. As to my young friend Freddy here, his naturally good
abilities and amiable temper ['Draw it mild, old fellow!' interrupted
the young gentleman in question] have interested us so much in his
favour that we cannot but view with regret a habit he has of late fallen
into, of turning everything into ridicule ['What a pity!' from the same
individual], together with a lamentable addiction to the use of slang
terms. Let me hope his association with such a polished young gentleman
as Mr. Fairlegh may improve him in these particulars."
</p>
<p>
"Who drank Mildman's ale at dinner?" asked Coleman; "if that's a
specimen of his polished manners, I think mine take the shine out of
them, rather." <span class="pagenum">[11]</span>"I assure you," interrupted I, eagerly, "I never was
more distressed in my life; it was quite a mistake."
</p>
<p>
"Pretty good mistake&mdash;Hodgson's pale ale for Muddytub's swipes&mdash;eh,
Mull?" rejoined Coleman.
</p>
<p>
"I believe you," replied Mullins.
</p>
<p>
"Well, now for entering your name; that's important, you know," said
Lawless; "you had better ring the bell, and tell Thomas to bring the
books."
</p>
<p>
I obeyed, and when Thomas made his appearance informed him of my desire
to enter my name in the books of the establishment, which I begged he
would bring for that purpose. A look of bewilderment that came over his
face on hearing my request changed to an expression of intelligence, as,
after receiving some masonic sign from Lawless, he replied:&mdash;
</p>
<p>
"The books, sir; yes, sir; bring 'em directly, sir ".
</p>
<p>
After a few minutes he returned with two small, not overclean, books,
ruled with blue lines. One of these Lawless took from him, opened with
much ceremony, and, covering the upper part of the page with a bit of
blotting paper, pointed to a line, and desired me to write my name and
age, as well as the date of my arrival, upon it. The .same ceremony was
repeated with the second.
</p>
<p>
"That's all right: now let's see how it reads," said he, and, removing
the blotting paper, read as follows: "'Pair of Wellingtons, £1 15s.;
satin stock, 25s.; cap ribbon for Sally Duster, 2s. 6d.; box of cigars,
£1 16s. (mem. shocking bad lot)&mdash;5th Nov., Francis Fairlegh, aged
15'.&mdash;So much for that; now, let's see the next: 'Five shirts, four pair
of stockings, six pocket-handkerchiefs, two pair of white ducks&mdash;5th
Nov., Francis Fairlegh, aged 15'."
</p>
<p>
Here his voice was drowned in a roar of laughter from the whole party
assembled, Thomas included, during which the true state of the case
dawned upon me, viz.&mdash;that I had, with much pomp and ceremony, entered
my name, age, and the date of my arrival in Mr. George Lawless's private
account and washing books!
</p>
<p>
My thoughts, as I laid my aching head upon my pillow that night, were
not of the most enviable nature. Leaving for the first time the home
where I had lived from childhood, and in which I had met with affection
and kindness from all around me, had been a trial under which my
fortitude would most assuredly have given way, but for the brilliant
picture my imagination had very obligingly sketched of the happy family
of which I was about to become a member; in the foreground of which
stood a group of fellow-pupils, a united brotherhood of congenial
<span class="pagenum">[12]</span>souls,, containing three bosom friends at the very least, anxiously
awaiting my arrival with outstretched arms of welcome. Now, however,
this last hope had failed me; for, innocent (or, as Coleman would have
termed it, green) as I then was, I could not but perceive that the tone
of mock politeness assumed towards me by Cumberland and Lawless was
merely a convenient cloak for impertinence, which could be thrown aside
at any moment when a more open display of their powers of tormenting
should seem advisable. In fact (though I was little aware of the
pleasures in store for me), I had already seen enough to prove that the
life of a private pupil was not exactly "all my fancy painted it"; and,
as the misery of leaving those I loved proved in its "sad reality"
a much more serious affair than I had imagined, the result of my
cogitations was, that I was a very unhappy boy (I did not feel the
smallest inclination to boast myself <i>man</i> at that moment), and that, if
something very much to my advantage did not turn up in the course of
the next twenty-four hours, my friends would have the melancholy
satisfaction of depositing a broken heart (which, on the principle of
the Kilkenny cats, was all I expected would remain of me by that time)
in an early grave. Hereabouts my feelings becoming too many for me
at the thought of my own funeral, I fairly gave up the struggle, and,
bursting into a flood of tears, cried myself to sleep, like a child.

    CHAPTER II &mdash; LOSS AND GAIN
</h2>
<pre>
     "And youthful still, in your doublet and hose, this raw
     rheumatic day?"

     "His thefts were too open; his filching was like an
     unskilful singer, he kept not time.... Convey, the wise
     it call. 'Steal!' foh! a fico for the phrase!"&mdash;

</pre>
<p>
AMONGST the minor phenomena which are hourly occurring in the details
of everyday life, although we are seldom sufficiently close observers to
perceive them, there is none more remarkable than the change wrought in
our feelings and ideas by a good night's rest; and never was this change
more strikingly exemplified than on the present occasion. I had fallen
asleep in the act of performing the character of chief-mourner at my own
funeral, and I awoke <span class="pagenum">[13]</span>in the highest possible health and spirits,
with a strong determination never to "say die" under any conceivable
aspect affairs might assume. "What in the world," said I to myself, as I
sprang out of bed, and began to dress,&mdash;"What in the world was there for
me to make myself so miserable about last night? Suppose Cumberland and
Lawless should laugh at, and tease me a little at first, what does it
signify? I must take it in good part as long as I can, and if that does
not do I must speak seriously to them&mdash;tell them they really annoy me
and make me uncomfortable, and then, of course, they will leave off. As
to Coleman, I am certain&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;Well, it's very odd!"&mdash;this last remark
was elicited by the fact that a search I had been making for some
minutes, in every place possible and impossible, for that indispensable
article of male attire, my trousers, had proved wholly ineffectual,
although I had a distinct recollection of having placed them carefully
on a chair by my bedside the previous night. There, however, they
certainly were not now, nor, as far as I could discover, anywhere else
in the room. Under these circumstances, ringing the bell for Thomas
seemed advisable, as it occurred to me that he had probably abstracted
the missing garment for the purpose of brushing. In a few moments he
answered the summons, and, with a face bright from the combined effects
of a light heart and a severe application of yellow soap, inquired, "if
I had rung for my shaving water?"
</p>
<p>
"Why, no&mdash;-I do not&mdash;that is, it was not&mdash;I seldom shave of a morning;
for the fact is, I have no beard to shave as yet."
</p>
<p>
"Oh, sir, that's no reason; there's Mr. Coleman's not got the leastest
westige of a hair upon his chin, and he's been mowing away with the
greatest of persewerance for the last six months, and sends his rashier
to be ground every three weeks, regilar, in order to <i>get</i> a beard&mdash;but
what can I do for you, sir?"
</p>
<p>
"Why," replied I, trying to look grave, "it's very odd, but I have
lost&mdash;that is, I can't find&mdash;my trousers anywhere. I put them on this
chair last night, I know."
</p>
<p>
"Umph! that's sing'lar, too; I was just a coming upstairs to brush 'em
for you; you did not hear anybody come into your room after you went to
bed, did you, sir?"
</p>
<p>
"No; but then I was so tired&mdash;I slept as sound as a top."
</p>
<p>
"Ah! I shouldn't much wonder if Mr. Coleman knew something about 'em:
perhaps you had better put on another pair, and, if I can find 'em, I'll
bring 'em back after breakfast."
</p>
<p>
This was very good advice, and, therefore, of course, <span class="pagenum">[14]</span>impossible
to follow; for, on examining my trunk, lo and behold! dress pantaloons,
white ducks, <i>et hoc genus omne</i>, had totally disappeared, and I seemed
to stand a very good chance of making my first appearance at my tutor's
breakfast-table in an extemporary "kilt," improvised for the occasion
out of two towels and a checked neckcloth. In this extremity Thomas, as
a last resource, knocked at Coleman's door, informing him that I
should be glad to speak to him&mdash;a proceeding speedily followed by the
appearance of that gentleman <i>in propria persona</i>.
</p>
<p>
"Good-morning, Fairlegh! hope you slept well. You are looking cold; had
not you better get some clothes on? Mildman will be down in a minute,
and there will be a pretty row if we are not all there; he's precious
particular, I can tell you."
</p>
<p>
"That is exactly what I want to do," replied I; "but the fact is,
somebody has taken away all my trousers in the night."
</p>
<p>
"Bless me! you don't say so? Another case of pilfering! this is getting
serious: I will call Lawless&mdash;I say, Lawless!" "Well, what's the row?"
was the reply. "Have the French landed? or is the kitchen chimney on
fire? eh! What do I behold! Fairlegh, lightly and elegantly attired in
nothing but his shirt, and Thomas standing like Niobe, the picture of
woe! Here's a sight for a father!"
</p>
<p>
"Why, it's a bad job," said Coleman; "do you know, here's another case
of pilfering; Fairlegh has had all his trousers stolen in the night."
</p>
<p>
"You don't say so!" rejoined Lawless: "what is to be done? It must be
stopped somehow: we had better tell him all we know about it. Thomas,
leave the room."
</p>
<p>
Thomas obeyed, giving me a look of great intelligence, the meaning of
which, however, I was totally at a loss to conceive, as he went; and
Lawless continued:&mdash;
</p>
<p>
"I am afraid you will hardly believe us,&mdash;it is really a most unheard-of
thing,&mdash;but we have lately missed a great many of our clothes, and we
have every reason to suspect (I declare I can scarcely bear to mention
it) that Mildman takes them himself, fancying, of course, that, placed
by his position so entirely above suspicion, he may do it with
impunity. We have suspected this for some time; and lately one or two
circumstances&mdash;old clothesmen having been observed leaving his study, a
pawn-ticket falling out of his waistcoat pocket one day as he went out
of our parlour, etc.&mdash;have put the matter beyond a doubt; but he has
never gone to such an extent as this before. Mind you don't mention a
word of this to Thomas, for, bad as <span class="pagenum">[15]</span>Mildman is, one would not wish
to show him up before his own servant."
</p>
<p>
"Good gracious!" cried I, "but you are joking, it never can be
really true!" Reading, however, in the solemn, not to say distressed,
expression of their faces indisputable evidence of the reality of the
accusation, I continued: "I had no idea such things ever could take
place, and he a clergyman, too!&mdash;dreadful! but what in the world am I
to do? I have not got a pair of trousers to put on. Oh! if he would
but have taken anything else, even my watch instead, I should not have
minded&mdash;what shall I do?"
</p>
<p>
"Why really," replied Coleman, "it is not so easy to advise: you can't
go down as you are, that's certain. Suppose you were to wrap yourself up
in a blanket, and go and tell him you have found him out, and that you
will call a policeman if he does not give you your clothes instantly;
have it out with him fairly, and check the thing effectually once for
all&mdash;eh?"
</p>
<p>
"No, that won't do," said Lawless. "I should say, sit down quietly (how
cold you must be!) and write him a civil note, saying, that you had
reason to believe he had borrowed your trousers (that's the way I should
put it), and that you would be very much gratified by his lending you
a pair to wear to-day; and then you can stick in something about
your having been always accustomed to live with people who were very
particular in regard to dress, and that you are sorry you are obliged to
trouble him for such a trifle; in fact, do a bit of the respectful, and
then pull up short with 'obedient pupil,' etc."
</p>
<p>
"Ay, that's the way to do it," said Coleman, "in the shop-fellow's
style, you know&mdash;much obliged for past favours, and hope for a
continuance of the same&mdash;more than <i>you</i> do, though, Fairlegh, I should
fancy; but there goes the bell&mdash;I am off," and away he scudded, followed
by Lawless humming:&mdash;
</p>
<pre>
          "Brian O'Lynn had no breeches to wear,
          So he took an old catskin, and made him a pair."
</pre>
<p>
Here was a pretty state of things: the breakfast bell had rung, and I,
who considered being too late a crime of the first magnitude, was unable
even to begin dressing from the melancholy fact that every pair of
trousers I possessed in the world had disappeared; while, to complete my
misery, I was led to believe the delinquent who had abstracted them
was no less a person than the tutor, whom I had come fully prepared to
regard with feelings of the utmost respect and veneration.
</p>
<p>
<span class="pagenum">[16]</span>However, in such a situation, thinking over my miseries was worse
than useless; <i>something</i> must be done at once&mdash;but what? Write the note
as Lawless had advised? No, it was useless to think of that; I felt
I could not do it. "Ah! a bright idea!&mdash;I'll try it." So, suiting the
action to the word, I rang the bell, and then jumping into bed muffled
myself up in the bedclothes.
</p>
<p>
"Well, sir, have you found them?" asked Thomas, entering.
</p>
<p>
"No, Thomas," replied I dolefully, "nor ever shall, I fear; but will you
go to 'Dr. Mildman, and tell him, with my respects, that I cannot get up
to breakfast this morning, and, if he asks what is the matter with me,
say that I am prevented from coming down by <i>severe cold</i>. I am sure
that is true enough," added I, shivering.
</p>
<p>
"Well, sir, I will, if you wish it; but I don't exactly see the good of
it; you <i>must</i> get up some time or other."
</p>
<p>
"I don't know," replied I gloomily, "we shall see; only do you take my
message."
</p>
<p>
And he accordingly left the room, muttering as he did so, "Well, I calls
this a great deal too bad, and I'll tell master of it myself, if nobody
else won't".
</p>
<p>
"Tell master of it himself!"&mdash;he also suspected him then. This crushed
my last faint hope that, after all, it might turn out to be only a trick
of the pupils; and, overpowered by the utter vileness and depravity of
him who was set in authority over me, I buried my face in the pillow,
feeling a strong inclination to renew the lamentations of the preceding
night. Not many minutes had elapsed when the sound of a heavy footstep
slowly ascending the stairs attracted my attention. I raised my head,
and beheld the benevolent countenance (for even then it certainly did
wear a benevolent expression) of my wicked tutor, regarding me with a
mingled look of scrutiny and pity.
</p>
<p>
"Why, Fairlegh, what's all this?&mdash;Thomas tells me you are not able to
come down to breakfast; you are not ill, I hope?"
</p>
<p>
"No, sir," replied I, "I don't think I am very ill, but I <i>can't</i> come
down to breakfast."
</p>
<p>
"Not ill, and yet you can't come down to breakfast! pray, what in the
world prevents you?"
</p>
<p>
"Perhaps," said I (for I was becoming angry at what I considered his
unparalleled effrontery, and thought I would give him a hint that he
could not deceive me so easily as he seemed to expect), "perhaps you can
tell that better than I can."
</p>
<p>
<span class="pagenum">[17]</span>"I, my boy!&mdash;I'm afraid not; my pretensions to the title of doctor
are based on divinity, not physic:&mdash;however, put out your tongue&mdash;that's
right enough; let me feel your hand&mdash;a little cold or so, but nothing to
signify; did this kind of seizure ever happen to you at home?"
</p>
<p>
Well, this was adding insult to injury with a vengeance; not content
with stealing my clothes himself, but actually asking me whether such
things did not happen at home! The wretch! thought I; does he suppose
that everybody is as wicked as himself?
</p>
<p>
"No," I answered, my voice trembling with the anger I was scarcely
able to repress; "no, sir, such a thing never could happen in my dear
father's house."
</p>
<p>
"There, don't agitate yourself; you seem excited: perhaps you <i>had</i>
better lie in bed a little longer; I will send you up something warm,
and after that you may feel more inclined to get up," said he kindly,
adding to himself, as he left the room, "Very strange boy&mdash;I can't make
him out at all".
</p>
<p>
The door closed, and I was once more alone. "Is he guilty or not
guilty?" thought I; "if he really has taken the clothes, he is the most
accomplished hypocrite I ever heard of; yet he <i>must</i> have done so,
everything combines to prove it&mdash;Thomas's speech&mdash;nay, even his own
offer of sending me 'something warm'; something warm, indeed! what do
I want with anything warm, except my trousers? No! the fact was beyond
dispute; they were gone, and he had stolen them, whilst I, unhappy
youth, was entirely in his power, and had not therefore a chance
of redress. 'But I will not bear it,' cried I, 'I'll write to my
father&mdash;I'll run away&mdash;I'll&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;'"
</p>
<p>
"Hurrah!" shouted Thomas, rushing into the room with his arm full of
clothes, "here they are, sir; I have found the whole kit of them at
last."
</p>
<p>
"Where?" exclaimed I eagerly.
</p>
<p>
"Where? why in such a queer place!" replied he, "stuffed up the chimbley
in master's study; but I have given them a good brushing, and they are
none the worse for it, except them blessed white ducks; they are almost
black ducks now, though they will wash, so that don't signify none."
</p>
<p>
"Up the chimney, in master's study!" here was at last proof positive; my
clothes had been actually found in his possession&mdash;oh, the wickedness of
this world!
</p>
<p>
"But how did you ever find them?" asked I.
</p>
<p>
"Why! I happened to go in to fetch something, and I see'd a little bit
of the leg of one of them hanging down <span class="pagenum">[18]</span>the chimbley, so I guessed
how it all was, directly. I think I know how they got there, too; they
did not walk there by themselves, I should say."
</p>
<p>
"I wish they had," muttered I.
</p>
<p>
"I thought <i>somebody</i> was up too early this morning to be about any
good," continued he; "he is never out of bed till the last moment,
without there's some mischief in the wind."
</p>
<p>
This was pretty plain speaking, however. Thomas was clearly as well
aware of his master's nefarious practices as the pupils themselves,
and Lawless's amiable desire to conceal Dr. Mildman's sins from his
servant's knowledge was no longer of any avail. I hastened, therefore
(the only reason for silence being thus removed), to relieve my mind
from the burden of just indignation which was oppressing it.
</p>
<p>
"And can you, Thomas," exclaimed I, with flashing eyes, "remain the
servant of a man who dares thus to outrage every law, human and divine?
one who having taken upon himself the sacred office of a clergyman of
the Church of England, and so made it his especial duty to set a good
example to all around him, can take advantage of the situation in which
he is placed in regard to his pupils, and actually demean himself by
purloining the clothes of the young men" (I felt five-and-twenty at
the very least at that moment) "committed to his charge?&mdash;why, my
father&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>
<p>
What I imagined my father would have said or done under these
circumstances was fated to remain a mystery, as my eloquence was brought
to a sudden conclusion by my consternation, when a series of remarkable
phenomena, which had been developing themselves during my harangue in
the countenance of Thomas, terminated abruptly in what appeared to me a
fit of most unmitigated insanity. A look of extreme astonishment, which
he had assumed at the beginning of my speech, had given place to an
expression of mingled surprise and anger as I continued; which again
in its turn had yielded to a grin of intense amusement, growing every
moment broader and broader, accompanied by a spasmodic twitching of his
whole person; and, as I mentioned his master's purloining my trousers,
he suddenly sprang up from the floor nearly a yard high, and commenced
an extempore <i>pas seul</i> of a Jim Crow character, which he continued with
unabated vigour during several minutes. This "<i>Mazurka d'ecstase</i>," or
whatever a ballet-master would have called it, having at length, to my
great joy, concluded, the performer of it sank exhausted into a chair,
and regarding me with a face still <span class="pagenum">[19]</span>somewhat the worse for his late
violent exertions favoured me with the following geographical remark:&mdash;
</p>
<p>
"Well, I never did believe in the existence of sich a place as Greenland
before, but there's nowhere else as you could have come from, sir, I am
certain."
</p>
<p>
"Eh! why! what's the matter with you? have I done anything particularly
'green,' as you call it? what are you talking about?" said I, not
feeling exactly pleased at the reception my virtuous indignation had met
with.
</p>
<p>
"Oh! don't be angry, sir; I am sure I did not mean to offend you; but
really I could not help it, when I heard you say about master's having
stole your things. Oh lor!" he added, holding his sides with both hands,
"how my precious sides do ache, sure-ly!"
</p>
<p>
"Do you consider that any laughing matter?" said I, still in the dark.
</p>
<p>
"Oh! don't, sir, don't say it again, or you will be the death of
me," replied Thomas, struggling against a relapse; "why, bless your
innocence, what could ever make you think master would take your
clothes?"
</p>
<p>
"Make me think? why, Lawless told me so," answered I, "and he also said
it was not the first time such a thing had occurred either."
</p>
<p>
"You'll have enough to do, sir, if you believe all our young gents tell
you; why, master would as soon think of flying as of stealing anything.
It was Mr. Coleman as put them up the chimbley; he's always a playing
some trick or another for everlasting."
</p>
<p>
A pause ensued, during which the whole affair in its true bearings
became for the first time clear to my mind's eye; the result of my
cogitations may be gathered from the following remark, which escaped me
as it were involuntarily&mdash;"What a confounded ass I have made of myself,
<i>to be sure</i>!"
</p>
<p>
Should any of my readers be rude enough to agree with me in this
particular, let them reflect for a moment on the peculiar position
in which I was placed. Having lived from childhood in a quiet country
parsonage, with my father and mother, and a sister younger than myself,
as my sole companions, "mystification"&mdash;that is, telling deliberate
falsehoods by way of a joke&mdash;was a perfectly novel idea to me; and,
when that joke involved the possibility of such serious consequences as
offending the tutor under whose care we were placed, I (wholly ignorant
of the impudence and recklessness of public school boys) considered such
a solution of the mystery inconceivable. Moreover, everything around me
was so strange, and so entirely <span class="pagenum">[20]</span>different from the habits of life
in which I had been hitherto brought up, that for the time my mind was
completely bewildered. I appeared to have lost my powers of judgment,
and to have relapsed, as far as intellect was concerned, into childhood
again. My readers must excuse this digression, but it appeared to me
necessary to explain how it was possible for a lad of fifteen to have
been made the victim of such a palpably absurd deception without its
involving the necessity of his not being "so sharp as he should be".
</p>
<p>
The promised "something warm" made its appearance ere long, in the shape
of tea and toast, which, despite my alarming seizure, I demolished with
great gusto in bed (for I did not dare to get up), feeling, from the
fact of my having obtained it under false pretences, very like a culprit
all the while. Having finished my breakfast, and allowed sufficient time
to elapse for my recovery, I got up, and, selecting a pair of trousers
which appeared to have suffered less from their sojourn in the chimney
than the others, dressed myself, and soon after eleven o'clock made my
appearance in the pupils' room, where I found Dr. Mildman seated at his
desk, and the pupils apparently very hard at work.
</p>
<p>
"How do you find yourself now you are up, Fairlegh?" inquired my tutor
kindly.
</p>
<p>
"Quite well, sir, thank you," I replied, feeling like an impostor.
</p>
<p>
"Quite recovered?" continued he.
</p>
<p>
"Everything&mdash;entirely, I mean," stammered I, thinking of my trousers.
</p>
<p>
"That's well, and now let us see what kind of Latin and Greek lining you
have got to your head."
</p>
<p>
So saying, without appearing to notice the tittering of the pupils, he
pointed to a seat by his side, and commenced what I considered a very
formidable examination, with the view of eliciting the extent of my
acquaintance with the writers of antiquity, which proved to be extremely
select. When he had thoroughly satisfied (or dissatisfied) himself upon
this point, he recommended Horace and Xenophon to my particular notice,
adding, that Coleman was also directing his attention to the sayings
and doings of the same honourable and learned gentlemen&mdash;and that,
therefore, we were to work together. He then explained to me certain
rules and regulations of his establishment, to which he added a few
moral remarks, conveying the information, that, if I always did exactly
what he considered right, and scrupulously avoided everything he deemed
wrong, I might relieve my mind from all fears of <span class="pagenum">[21]</span>his displeasure,
which was, to say the least, satisfactory, if not particularly original.
</p>
<p>
Exactly as the clock struck one Dr. Mildman left the room (the morning's
"study," as it was called, ending at that hour), leaving us our own
masters till five, at which time we dined. Lest any kind reader should
fancy we were starved, let me add, that at half-past one a substantial
luncheon was provided, of which we might partake or not as we pleased.
As well as I remember we generally did graciously incline towards the
demolition of the viands, unless "metal more attractive" awaited us
elsewhere&mdash;but I am digressing.

<h2>
    CHAPTER III &mdash; COLD-WATER CURE FOR THE HEARTACHE
</h2>
<pre>
          "Oh! grief for words too deep,
          From all his loved ones parted,

          He could not choose but weep,
          He was so lonely-hearted."
          &mdash;Shortfellow.
</pre>
<pre>
          "How does the water come down at Lodore?

          Dashing and flashing, and splashing and clashing,
          All at once and all o'er, with a mighty uproar,
          And this way the water comes down at Lodore."
          &mdash;Southey.
</pre>
<p>
"PRAY, Fairlegh, what did you mean by not coming down till eleven
o'clock?" asked Cumberland in an angry tone.
</p>
<p>
"Did its mamma say it was always to have its breakfast in bed, a dear?"
sneered Lawless.
</p>
<p>
"When she fastened that pretty square collar round its neck," chimed in
Coleman.
</p>
<p>
"Just like a great gal," added Mullins.
</p>
<p>
"Mildman was exceedingly angry about it, I can tell you," continued
Cumberland, "and desired me to speak seriously to you on the subject;
such abominable idleness is not to be tolerated."
</p>
<p>
"It was not idleness," answered I, warmly; "you all know very well, why
I could not come down, and I don't think it was at all right or kind of
you to play me such a trick."
</p>
<p>
"Eh&mdash;now don't say that&mdash;you will hurt my feelings; I declare it
is quite affecting," said Coleman, wiping his eyes with Mullins's
handkerchief, of which he had just picked his pocket.
</p>
<p>
<span class="pagenum">[22]</span>"I'd have given five pounds to have seen old Sam's phiz, when he
was trying to make out what ailed young stupid here, whether he was
really ill, or only shamming," said Lawless; "depend upon it, he thinks
it was all pretence, and he can't bear anything of that sort; that was
why he began spinning him that long yarn about 'meriting his approbation
by upright and straightforward conduct,' this morning. I saw what the
old boy was aiming at in a minute; there's nothing puts him out so much
as being deceived."
</p>
<p>
"Won't he set him all the hard lines to construe? that's all," said
Mullins.
</p>
<p>
"It will be 'hard lines' upon him if he does," observed Coleman.
</p>
<p>
"Hold your tongue, Freddy! your puns are enough to make one ill," said
Cumberland.
</p>
<p>
"Well, I don't know whether you are going to stand here all day baiting
your pinafore, Cumberland?" interrupted Lawless; "I'm not, for I've got
a horse waiting for me down at Snaffles's, and I am going to ride over
to Hookley; there's a pigeon-match coming off to-day between Clayton, of
the Lancers&mdash;(he was just above me at Eton, you know)&mdash;and Tom Horton,
who won the great match at Pinchley, and I have backed Clayton pretty
heavily&mdash;shall you come?"
</p>
<p>
"No," replied Cumberland, "no, I am going down to
F&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;Street."
</p>
<p>
"As usual, the board of green cloth, eh? you will go there once too
often, if you don't mind, old fellow." "That's my look out," replied
Cumberland. And away they went to their different pursuits, each, as
he left the room, making me a very low obeisance; Coleman taking the
trouble to open the door again after he had gone out, to beg, "that,
if I were going to write to my mother, I would tell her, with his love,
that she need not make herself in the least uneasy, as <i>he had quite</i>
got over his last little attack". In a few minutes they had all quitted
the house, and I remained the sole tenant of the pupils' room.
</p>
<p>
Many a long year has passed over my head since the day I am now
describing, and each (though my life has been on the whole as free
from care as that of most of the sons of Adam) has brought with it some
portion of sorrow or suffering to temper the happiness I have enjoyed,
and teach me the much-required lesson, that "here we have no abiding
place". I have lived to see bright hopes fade&mdash;high and noble
aspirations fall to the ground, checked <span class="pagenum">[23]</span>by the sordid policy of
worldly men&mdash;and the proud hearts which gave them birth become gradually
debased to the level of those around them, or break in the unequal
struggle&mdash;and these things have pained me. I have beheld those dear to
me stretched upon the bed of sickness, and taken from me by the icy
hand of death; and have deemed, as the grave closed over them, that my
happiness, as far as this world was concerned, was buried with them. I
have known (and this was grief indeed) those loved with all the warm
and trustful confidence of youth prove false and unworthy of such deep
affection; and have wished, in the bitterness of my soul, that the pit
had shut her mouth upon me also, so I had but died with my faith in them
unshaken. Still, although such sorrows as these may have produced a
more deep and lasting effect, I do not remember ever to have felt more
thoroughly desolate than upon the present occasion. The last scene,
though trifling in itself, had made a great impression upon me, from the
fact that it proved, as I considered, the animus of the pupils towards
me. "Every man's hand was against me." Even the oaf Mullins might insult
me with impunity; secure that, in so doing, if in nothing else, he
would be supported by the rest. Then I had offended my tutor, all my
predilections in whose favour had returned with double force, since I
had satisfied myself that he was not addicted to the commission of petty
larceny; offended him by allowing him to suppose that I had practised
a mean deception upon him. Moreover, it was impossible to explain my
conduct to him without showing up Coleman, an extreme measure for which
I was by no means prepared. Besides, every one would think, if I were to
do so, that I was actuated by a paltry spirit of malice, and that would
have been worse to bear than anything. No&mdash;turn my gaze to whichever
side I. would, the horizon seemed alike clouded; there was no comfort
for me anywhere. I looked at my watch&mdash;two o'clock! Three long hours to
dinner-time, in which I might do what I liked. <i>What I liked</i>! there was
mockery in the very sound. What was there for me to do? go out and see
more new faces looking coldly on me, and wander up and down in strange
places alone, amidst a crowd? No! I had not the heart to do that. Sit
down, and write home, and by telling them how miserable I was, render
them unhappy too?&mdash;that was worst of all. At length I found a book, and
began reading as it were mechanically, but so little was I able to fix
my attention that, had I been questioned at the end of the time as to
the subject of the work I had been <span class="pagenum">[24]</span>perusing, I should have been
utterly at a loss for an answer. I had fairly given it up as hopeless,
and closed the book, when I heard footsteps in the passage, followed by
the sudden apparition of the ever-smiling Mr. Frederick Coleman, who,
closing the door after him, accosted me as follows:&mdash;
</p>
<p>
"What, Fairlegh, all in the downs, old fellow?&mdash;'never say die!'&mdash;come,
be jolly&mdash;look at me".
</p>
<p>
As he said this I involuntarily raised my eyes to his features, and
certainly if ever there were a face formed for banishing blue devils by
a glance, it was his. It was a round face, not remarkable for beauty
of outline, inasmuch as it bore a strong resemblance to that of the
gentleman on the blue China plates, in two pigtails and a petticoat,
who appears to pass a mild ornithological and botanical existence in
studying intently certain fishy-looking birds, and a cannon-ball tree,
which form the leading feature of the landscape in his vicinity. With
regard to expression, however, Coleman had a decided advantage over
the Chinese horticulturist, for, whereas the countenance of the latter
gentleman expresses (if indeed it can be said to express anything) only
meek astonishment, Coleman's small black eyes danced and sparkled with
such a spirit of mischief and devilry, while such a fund of merriment,
and, as it now for the first time struck me, of good-nature also, lurked
about the corners of his mouth, that it seemed impossible to look at him
without feeling that there was something contagious in his hilarity.
</p>
<p>
"Why," said I, "everything here is so new to me, so entirely different
from all I have been accustomed to before, and the unkind&mdash;that is,
the odd way in which Lawless and the rest of you seem to behave to me,
treating me as if you thought I was either a fool or a baby&mdash;it all
seems so strange, that I confess I am not over-happy."
</p>
<p>
"Precious odd if you were, I think," replied Coleman; "and it was a
horrid shame of me to hide your trousers as I did this morning. Oh! how
delightfully miserable you did look, as you stood shivering up in the
cold! I'm sorry for it now, but I'm such a chap for a bit of fun, that
if a trick like that comes into my head, do it I must. Oh! I get into no
end of scrapes that way! Why it was but the other day I put a piece
of cobbler's wax on the seat of Mildman's chair, and ruined his best
Sunday-going sit-upons; he knew, too, who did it, I'm sure, for the next
day he gave me a double dose of Euclid, to take the nonsense out of me,
I suppose. He had better mind what he's at, though! I have got another
dodge ready for him <span class="pagenum">[25]</span>if he does not take care! But I did not mean to
annoy you: you behaved like a brick, too, in not saying anything about
it&mdash;I am really very sorry."
</p>
<p>
"Never mind," said I; "it's all right again now: I like a joke as well
as anybody when I know it's only fun; the thing I am afraid of now is,
that Dr. Mildman may think I wanted to deceive him, by pretending to be
ill, when I was not."
</p>
<p>
"I daresay he has got a pretty good notion how it is," said Coleman,
"but we'll get Thomas to tell him what I was up to, and that will set it
all straight again."
</p>
<p>
"That will be very kind indeed," replied I; "but will not Dr. Mildman be
angry with you about it?"
</p>
<p>
"Not he," said Coleman, "he never finds fault unless there's real
necessity for it; he's as good a fellow as ever lived, is old Sam, only
he's so precious slow."
</p>
<p>
"I am glad you like him, he seems so very kind and good-natured," said
I, "just the sort of person one should wish one's tutor to be. But about
Cumberland and Lawless; what kind of fellows are they when you come to
know them?"
</p>
<p>
"Oh, you will like Lawless well enough when he gets tired of bullying
you," replied Coleman; "though you need not stand so much of that as I
was obliged to bear; you are a good head taller than I am&mdash;let's look at
your arm; it would be all the better for a little more muscle, but that
will soon improve. I'll put on the gloves with you for an hour or so
every day."
</p>
<p>
"Put on the gloves!" repeated I; "how do you mean?&mdash;what has that to do
with Lawless?"
</p>
<p>
"Oh, you muff! don't you understand?&mdash;of course, I mean the
boxing-gloves; and when you know how to use your fists, if Lawless comes
it too strong, slip into him."
</p>
<p>
"He must bully a good deal before I am driven to that," replied I; "I
never struck a blow in anger in my life."
</p>
<p>
"You will see before long," rejoined Coleman; "but at all events there
is no harm in learning to use your fists; a man should always be able to
defend himself if he is attacked."
</p>
<p>
"Yes, that's very true," observed I; "but you have not told me anything
of Cumberland. Shall I ever like him, do you think?"
</p>
<p>
"Not if you are the sort of fellow I take you to be," replied he;
"there's something about Cumberland not altogether right, I fancy;
I'm not very strait-laced myself, particularly if there's any fun in a
thing, not so much so as I should be, I suspect; but Cumberland is too
bad even <span class="pagenum">[26]</span>for me; besides, there's no fun in what he does, and then
he's such a humbug&mdash;not straightforward and honest, you know. Lawless
would not be half such a bully either, if Cumberland did not set him
on. But don't you say a word about this to any one; Cumberland would
be ready to murder me, or to get somebody else to do it for him&mdash;that's
more in his way."
</p>
<p>
"Do not fear my repeating anything told me in confidence," replied
I; "but what do you mean when you say there's something wrong about
Cumberland?"
</p>
<p>
"Do you know what Lawless meant by the 'board of green cloth' this
morning?"
</p>
<p>
"No&mdash;it puzzled me."
</p>
<p>
"I will tell you then," replied Coleman, sinking his voice almost to a
whisper&mdash;"the billiard table!"
</p>
<p>
After telling me this, Coleman, evidently fearing to commit himself
further with one of whom he knew so little, turned the conversation,
and, finding it still wanted more than an hour to dinner, proposed that
we should take a stroll along the shore together. In the course of
our walk I acquired the additional information that another pupil was
expected in a few days&mdash;the only son of Sir John Oaklands, a baronet of
large fortune in Hertfordshire; and that an acquaintance of Coleman's,
who knew him, said he was a capital fellow, but very odd&mdash;though in what
the oddity consisted did not appear. Moreover, Coleman confirmed me in
my preconceived idea, that Mullins's genius lay at present chiefly in
the eating, drinking, and sleeping line&mdash;adding that, in his opinion,
he bore a striking resemblance to those somewhat dissimilar articles, a
muff and a spoon. In converse such as this, the time slipped away, till
we suddenly discovered that we had only a quarter of an hour left
in which to walk back to Langdale Terrace, and prepare for dinner;
whereupon a race began, in which my longer legs gave me so decided an
advantage over Coleman that he declared he would deliver me up to
the tender mercies of the "Society for the Prevention of Cruelty
to Animals," for what he was pleased to call "an aggravated case of
over-driving a private pupil".
</p>
<p>
We had not more than five minutes left when we arrived at Dr. Mildman's
door, Coleman affording a practical illustration of the truth of
the aphorism, that "it is the pace that kills"; so that Thomas's
injunction, "Look sharp, gentlemen," was scarcely necessary to induce
us to rush upstairs two steps at a time. In the same hurry I entered
my bedroom, without observing that the door was standing ajar rather
suspiciously, for which piece of inattention I <span class="pagenum">[27]</span>was rewarded by a
deluge of water, which wetted me from head to foot, and a violent blow
on the shoulder, which stretched me on the ground in the midst of a
puddle. That I may not keep the reader in suspense I will at once inform
him that I was indebted for this agreeable surprise to the kindness
and skill of Lawless, who, having returned from his pigeon-match
half-an-hour sooner than was necessary, had devoted it to the
construction of what he called a "booby trap," which ingenious piece of
mechanism was arranged in the following manner: The victim's room-door
was placed ajar, and upon the top thereof a Greek Lexicon, or any other
equally ponderous volume, was carefully balanced, and upon this was set
in its turn a jug of water. If all these were properly adjusted, the
catastrophe above described was certain to ensue when the door was
opened.

alt="Page27 Caught in a Trap 
">
</center>

<p>
"Fairly caught, by Jove," cried Lawless, who had been on the watch.
</p>
<p>
"By Jupiter Pluvius, you should have said," joined in Coleman, helping
me up again; for so sudden and unexpected had been the shock that I
had remained for a moment just as I had fallen, with a kind of vague
expectation that the roof of the house would come down upon me.
</p>
<p>
"I suppose I have to thank you for that," said I, turning to Lawless.
</p>
<p>
"Pray, don't mention it, Pinafore," was the answer; "what little trouble
I had in making the arrangement, I can assure you, was quite repaid by
its success."
</p>
<p>
"I'll certainly put on the gloves to-morrow," whispered I to Coleman&mdash;to
which he replied by a sympathetic wink, adding:&mdash;
</p>
<p>
"And now I think you had better get ready, more particularly as you
will have to find out 'how to dress <i>jugged hair</i>,' as the cookery-books
say".
</p>
<p>
By dint of almost superhuman exertions I did just contrive to get down
in time for dinner, though my unfortunate "jugged hair," which was
anything but dry, must have presented rather a singular appearance. In
the course of dinner Dr. Mildman told us that we should have the whole
of the next day to ourselves, as he was obliged to go to London on
business, and should not return till the middle of the day following&mdash;an
announcement which seemed to afford great satisfaction to his hearers,
despite an attempt made by Cumberland to keep up appearances, by putting
on a look of mournful resignation, which, being imitated by Coleman,
who, as might be expected, rather overdid the thing, failed most
signally. <span class="pagenum">[28]</span>

<p>
ON returning to the pupils' room Lawless commenced (to my great delight,
as I thereby enjoyed a complete immunity from his somewhat troublesome
attentions) a full, true, and particular account of the pigeon-match, in
which his friend Clayton had, with unrivalled skill, slain a sufficient
number of victims to furnish forth pies for the supply of the whole
mess during the ensuing fortnight. At length, however, all was said that
could be said, even upon this interesting subject, and the narrator,
casting his eyes around in search of wherewithal to amuse himself,
chanced to espy my new writing-desk, a parting gift from my little
sister Fanny, who, with the self-denial of true affection, had saved up
her pocket-money during many previous months in order to provide funds
for this munificent present.
</p>
<p>
"Pinafore, is that desk yours?" demanded Lawless.
</p>
<p>
Not much admiring the <i>sobriquet</i> by which he chose to address me, I did
not feel myself called upon to reply.
</p>
<p>
"Are you deaf, stupid? don't you hear me speaking to you?&mdash;where did you
get that writing-desk?"
</p>
<p>
Still I did not answer.
</p>
<p>
"Sulky, eh? I shall have to lick him before long, I see. Here you,
what's your name? Fairlegh, did your grand-mother give you that
writing-desk?"
</p>
<p>
"No," replied I, "my sister Fanny gave it to me the day before I left
home."
</p>
<p>
"Oh, you have got a sister Fanny, have you? how old is she, and what is
she like?"
</p>
<p>
"She is just thirteen, and she has got the dearest little face in the
world," answered I, earnestly, as the recollection of her bright blue
eyes and sunny smile came across me.
</p>
<p>
<span class="pagenum">[29]</span>"How interesting!" sighed Coleman; "it quite makes my heart beat;
you could not send for her, could you?"
</p>
<p>
"And she gave you that desk, did she?&mdash;how very kind of her," resumed
Lawless, putting the poker in the fire.
</p>
<p>
"Yes, was it not?" said I, eagerly. "I would not have any harm happen to
it for more than I can tell."
</p>
<p>
"So I suppose," replied Lawless, still devoting himself to the poker,
which was rapidly becoming red-hot. "Have you ever," continued he, "seen
this new way they have of ornamenting things? encaustic work, I think
they call it:&mdash;it's done by the application of heat, you know."
</p>
<p>
"I never even heard of it," said I.
</p>
<p>
"Ah! I thought not," rejoined Lawless. "Well, as I happen to understand
the process, I'll condescend to enlighten your ignorance. Mullins, give
me that desk."
</p>
<p>
"Don't touch it," cried I, bounding forward to the rescue; "I won't
have anything done to it."
</p>

</center>

<p>
My design was, however, frustrated by Cumberland and Lawless, who, both
throwing themselves upon me at the same moment, succeeded, despite
my struggles, in forcing me into a chair, where they held me, while
Mullins, by their direction, with the aid of sundry neckcloths, braces,
etc., tied me hand and foot; Coleman, who attempted to interfere in my
behalf, receiving a push which sent him reeling across the room, and a
hint that if he did not mind his own business he would be served in the
same manner.
</p>
<p>
Having thus effectually placed me <i>hors de combat</i>, Lawless took
possession of my poor writing-desk, and commenced tracing on the top
thereof, with the red-hot poker, what he was pleased to term a "design
from the antique," which consisted of a spirited outline of that
riddle-loving female the Sphinx, as she appeared when dressed in
top-boots and a wide-awake, and regaling herself with a choice cigar! He
was giving the finishing touch to a large pair of moustaches, with which
he had embellished her countenance, and which he declared was the only
thing wanting to complete the likeness to an old aunt of Dr. Mildman's,
whom the pupils usually designated by the endearing appellation of
"Growler," when the door opened, and Thomas announced that "Smithson"
was waiting to see Mr. Lawless.
</p>
<p>
"Oh yes, to be sure, let him come in; no, wait a minute. Here, you,
Coleman and Mullins, untie Fairlegh; be quick!&mdash;confound that desk,
how it smells of burning, and I have made my hands all black too. Well,
Smithson, have you brought the things?"
</p>
<p>
The person to whom this query was addressed was a <span class="pagenum">[30]</span>young man,
attired in the extreme of the fashion, who lounged into the room with
a "quite at home" kind of air, and, nodding familiarly all around,
arranged his curls with a ring-adorned hand, as he replied in a drawling
tone:&mdash;
</p>
<p>
"Ya'as, Mr. Lawless, we're all right&mdash;punctual to a moment&mdash;always ready
'to come to time,' as we say in the ring".
</p>
<p>
"Who is he?" whispered I to Coleman.
</p>
<p>
"Who is he?" replied Coleman; "why the best fellow in the world, to
be sure'. Not know Smithson, the prince of tailors, the tailor <i>par
excellence</i>! I suppose you never heard of the Duke of Wellington, have
you?"
</p>
<p>
I replied humbly that I believed I had heard the name of that
illustrious individual mentioned in connection with Waterloo and the
Peninsula&mdash;and that I was accustomed to regard him as the first man of
the age.
</p>
<p>
"Aye, well then, Smithson is the second; though I really don't know
whether he is not quite as great in his way as Wellington, upon my
honour. The last pair of trousers he made for Lawless were something
sublime, too good for this wicked world, a great deal."
</p>
<p>
During this brief conversation Smithson had been engaged in extricating
a somewhat voluminous garment from the interior of a blue bag, which a
boy, who accompanied him, had just placed inside the study-door.
</p>
<p>
"There, this is the new invention I told you about; a man named
Macintosh hit upon it. Now, with this coat on, you might stand under a
water-fall without getting even damp. Try it on, Mr. Lawless; just the
thing, eh, gents?"
</p>
<p>
Our curiosity being roused by this panegyric, we gathered round Lawless
to examine the garment which had called it forth. Such of my readers as
recollect the first introduction of Macintoshes will doubtless remember
that the earlier specimens of the race differed very materially in form
from those which are in use at the present day. The one we were now
inspecting was of a whity-brown colour, and, though it had sleeves like
a coat, hung in straight folds from the waist to the ankles, somewhat
after the fashion of a carter's frock, having huge pockets at the side,
and fastening round the neck with a hook and eye.
</p>
<p>
"How does it do?" asked Lawless, screwing himself round in an insane
effort to look at the small of his own back, a thing a man is certain
to attempt when trying on a coat. "It does not make a fellow look like a
Guy, does it?"
</p>
<p>
<span class="pagenum">[31]</span>"No, I rather admire the sort of thing," said Cumberland.
</p>
<p>
"A jolly dodge for a shower of rain, and no mistake," put in Coleman.
</p>
<p>
"It is deucedly fashionable, really," said Smithson&mdash;"this one of yours,
and one we made for Augustus Flareaway, Lord Fitz-scamper's son, the man
in the Guards, you know, are the only two out yet."
</p>
<p>
"I have just got it at the right time then," said Lawless; "I knew old
Sam was going to town, so I settled to drive Clayton over to Woodend, in
the tandem, to-morrow. The harriers meet there at eleven, and this will
be the very thing to hide the leathers, and tops, and the green cutaway.
I saw you at the match, by-the-by, Smithey, this morning."
</p>
<p>
"Ya'as, I was there; did you see the thing I was on?"
</p>
<p>
"A bright bay, with a star on the forehead! a spicy-looking nag
enough&mdash;whose is it?"
</p>
<p>
"Why, young Robarts, who came into a lot of tin the other day, has just
bought it; Snaffles charged him ninety guineas for it."
</p>
<p>
"And what is it worth?" asked Lawless.
</p>
<p>
"Oh! he would not do a dirty thing by any gent I introduced," replied
Smithson. "I took young Robarts there: he merely made his fair profit
out of it; he gave forty pounds for it himself to a man who bred it,
only the week before, to my certain knowledge: it's a very sweet thing,
and would carry him well, but he's afraid to ride it; that's how I was
on it to-day. I'm getting it steady for him."
</p>
<p>
"A thing it will take you some time to accomplish, eh? A mount like that
is not to be had for nothing, every day, is it?"
</p>
<p>
"Ya'as, you're about right there, Mr. Lawless; you're down to every
move, I see, as usual. Any orders to-day, gents? your two vests will be
home to-morrow, Mr. Coleman."
</p>
<p>
"Here, Smithson, wait a moment," said Cumberland, drawing him on one
side; "I was deucedly unlucky with the balls this morning," continued he
in a lower tone, "can you let me have five-and-twenty pounds?"
</p>
<p>
"What you please, sir," replied Smithson, bowing.
</p>
<p>
"On the old terms, I suppose?" observed Cumberland.
</p>
<p>
"All right," answered Smithson; "stay, I can leave it with you now,"
added he, drawing out a leather case; "oblige me by writing your name
here&mdash;thank you."
</p>
<p>
So saying, he handed some bank-notes to Cumberland, carefully replaced
the paper he had received from him in his pocket-book, and withdrew.
</p>
<p>
<span class="pagenum">[32]</span>"Smithey was in great force to-night," observed Lawless, as the
door closed behind him&mdash;"nicely they are bleeding that young ass Robarts
among them&mdash;he has got into good hands to help him to get rid of his
money, at all events. I don't believe Snaffles gave forty pounds for
that bay horse; he has got a decided curb on the off hock, if I ever
saw one, and I fancy he's a little touched in the wind, too and there's
another thing I should say&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>
<p>
What other failing might be attributed to Mr. Robarts' bay steed
we were, however, not destined to learn, as tea was at this moment
announced. In due time followed evening prayers, after which we retired
for the night. Being very sleepy I threw off my clothes, and jumped
hastily into bed, by which act I became painfully aware of the presence
of what a surgeon would term "certain foreign bodies"&mdash;i.e., not, as
might be imagined, sundry French, German, and Italian corpses, but
various hard substances, totally opposed to one's preconceived ideas of
the component parts of a feather-bed. Sleep being out of the question on
a couch so constituted, I immediately commenced an active search, in the
course of which I succeeded in bringing to light two clothes-brushes,
a boot-jack, a pair of spurs, Lemprière's <i>Classical Dictionary</i> and a
brick-bat. Having freed myself from these undesirable bed-fellows I soon
fell asleep, and passed (as it seemed to me) the whole night in dreaming
that I was a pigeon, or thereabouts, and that Smithson, mounted on the
top-booted Sphinx, was inciting Lawless to shoot at me with a red-hot
poker.
</p>
<p>
As Coleman and I were standing at the window of the pupils' room, about
ten o'clock on the following morning, watching the vehicle destined to
convey Dr. Mildman to the coach-office, Lawless made his appearance,
prepared for his expedition, with his hunting-costume effectually
concealed under the new Macintosh.
</p>
<p>
"Isn't Mildman gone yet? Deuce take it, what a time he is! I ought to be
off&mdash;I'm too late already!"
</p>
<p>
"They have not even put his carpet-bag in yet," said I.
</p>
<p>
"Well, I shall make a bolt, and chance it about his seeing me,"
exclaimed Lawless; "he'll only think I'm going out for a walk rather
earlier than usual, if he does catch a glimpse of me, so here's off."
</p>
<p>
Thus saying, he placed his hat upon his head, with the air of a man
determined to do or die, and vanished.
</p>
<p>
Fortune is currently reported to favour the brave, and so, to do her
justice, she generally does; still, at the best of times, she is but a
fickle jade, at all events she appeared determined to prove herself so
in the present instance; for <span class="pagenum">[33]</span>scarcely had Lawless got a dozen paces
from the house, before Dr. Mildman appeared at the front door with
his great coat and hat on, followed by Thomas bearing a carpet-bag and
umbrella, and, his attention being attracted by footsteps, he turned his
head, and beheld Lawless. As soon as he perceived him he gave a start of
surprise, and, pulling out his eye-glass (he was rather short-sighted),
gazed long and fixedly after the retreating figure. At length, having
apparently satisfied himself as to the identity of the person he was
examining, he replaced his glass, stood for a moment as if confounded by
what he had seen, and then turning, abruptly re-entered the house,
and shut his study-door behind him with a bang, leaving Thomas and the
fly-driver mute with astonishment. In about five minutes he re-appeared,
and saying to Thomas, in a stern tone, "Let that note be given to Mr.
Lawless the moment he returns," got into the fly and drove off.
</p>
<p>
"There's a precious go," observed Coleman; "I wonder what's in the wind
now. I have not seen old Sam get up the steam like that since I have
been here. He was not half so angry when I put Thomas's hat on the peg
where he hangs his own, and he, never noticing the difference, put it
on, and walked to church in it, gold band and all."
</p>
<p>
"I wouldn't be Lawless for something," observed I; "I wonder what the
note's about?"
</p>
<p>
"That's just what puzzles me," said Coleman. "I should have thought
he had seen the sporting togs, but that's impossible; he must have a
penetrating glance indeed if he could see through that Macintosh."
</p>
<p>
"Lawless was too impatient," said Cumberland; "he should have waited a
few minutes longer, and then Mildman would have gone off without knowing
anything about him. Depend upon it, the grand rule of life is to take
things coolly, and wait for an opportunity: you have the game in your
own hands then, and can take advantage of the follies and passions of
others, instead of allowing them to avail themselves of yours."
</p>
<p>
"In plain English, cheat instead of being cheated," put in Coleman.
</p>
<p>
"You're not far wrong there, Freddy; the world is made up of knaves and
fools&mdash;those who cheat, and those who are cheated&mdash;and I, for one, have
no taste for being a fool," said Cumberland.
</p>
<p>
"Nor I," said Mullins; "I should not like to be a fool at all; I had
rather be&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>
<p>
"A butterfly," interrupted Coleman, thereby astonishing Mullins to such
a degree that he remained silent for <span class="pagenum">[34]</span>some moments, with his mouth
wide open as if in the act of speaking.
</p>
<p>
"You cannot mean what you say; you surely would not wish to cheat
people," said I to Cumberland; "if it were really true that one must
be either a knave or a fool, I'd rather be a fool by far&mdash;I'm sure you
could never be happy if you cheated any one," continued I. "What does
the Bible say about doing to others as you would have others do to you?"
</p>
<p>
"There, don't preach to me, you canting young prig," said Cumberland
angrily, and immediately left the room.
</p>
<p>
"You hit him pretty hard then," whispered Coleman; "a very bad piece
of business happened just before I came, about his winning a lot of tin
from a young fellow here, at billiards, and they do say that Cumberland
did not play fairly. It was rather unlucky your saying it; he will
be your enemy from henceforth, depend upon it. He never forgets nor
forgives a thing of that sort."
</p>
<p>
"I meant no harm by the remark," replied I; "I knew nothing of his
having cheated any one; however, I do not care; I don't like him, and
I'm just as well pleased he should not like me. But now, as my foreign
relations seem to be rapidly assuming a warlike character (as the
newspapers have it), what do you say to giving me a lesson in sparring,
as you proposed, by way of preparation?"
</p>
<p>
"With all my heart," replied Coleman.
</p>
<p>
And accordingly the gloves were produced, and my initiatory lesson
in the pugilistic art commenced by Coleman's first placing me in an
exceedingly uncomfortable attitude, and then very considerately knocking
me out of it again, thereby depositing me with much skill and science
flat upon the hearth-rug. This manouvre he repeated with great success
during some half hour or so, at the end of which time I began to
discover the knack with which it was done, and proceeded to demonstrate
the proficiency I was making, by a well-directed blow, which, being
delivered with much greater force than I had intended, sent Coleman
flying across the room. Chancing to encounter Mullins in the course, of
his transit he overturned that worthy against the table in the centre of
the apartment, which, yielding to their combined weight, fell over with
a grand crash, dragging them down with it, in the midst of an avalanche
of books, papers, and inkstands.
</p>
<p>
This <i>grand coup</i> brought, as might be expected, our lesson to a close
for the day, Coleman declaring that such another hit would inevitably
knock him into the middle of next week, if not farther, and that
he really should not feel <span class="pagenum">[35]</span>justified in allowing such a serious
interruption to his studies to take place.
</p>
<p>
"And now, what are we going to do with ourselves?" asked I; "as this is
a holiday, we ought to do something."
</p>
<p>
"Are you fond of riding?" inquired Coleman.
</p>
<p>
"Nothing I like better," replied I; "I have been used to it all my life;
I have had a pony ever since I was four years old."
</p>
<p>
"I wish I was used to it," said Coleman. "My governor living in London,
I never crossed a horse till I came here, and I'm a regular muff at it;
but I want to learn. What do you say to a ride this afternoon?"
</p>
<p>
"Just the thing," said I, "if it is not too expensive for my pocket."
</p>
<p>
"Oh no," replied Coleman; "Snaffles lets horses at as cheap a rate as
any one, and good 'uns to go, too; does not he, Cumberland?"
</p>
<p>
"Eh, what are you talking about?" said Cumberland, who had just entered
the room; "Snaffles? Oh yes, he's the man for horse flesh. Are you going
to amuse yourself by tumbling off that fat little cob of his again,
Fred?"
</p>
<p>
"I was thinking of having another try," replied Coleman; "what do you
say, Fairlegh? Never mind the tin; I daresay you have got plenty, and
can get more when that's gone."
</p>
<p>
"I have got a ten-pound note," answered I; "but that must last me all
this quarter: however, we'll have our ride to-day."
</p>
<p>
"I'll walk down with you," said Cumberland; "I'm going that way;
besides, it's worth a walk any day to see Coleman mount; it took him ten
minutes the last time I saw him, and then he threw the wrong leg over,
so that he turned his face to the tail."
</p>
<p>
"<i>Scandalum magnatum!</i> not a true bill," replied Coleman.
</p>
<p>
"Now, come along, Fairlegh, let's get ready, and be off." During our
walk down to Snaffles' stables Cumberland (who seemed entirely to have
forgotten my <i>mal à propos</i> remark) talked to me in a much more amiable
manner than he had yet done; and the conversation naturally turning upon
horses and riding, a theme always interesting to me, I was induced to
enter into sundry details of my own exploits in that line. We reached
the livery stables just as I had concluded a somewhat egotistical
relation concerning a horse which a gentleman in our neighbourhood had
bought for his invalid son, but which, proving at first too spirited,
I had undertaken to ride every day for a <span class="pagenum">[36]</span>month in order to get him
quiet; a feat I was rather proud of having satisfactorily accomplished.
</p>
<p>
"Good-morning, Mr. Snaffles; is Punch at home?" asked Coleman of a stout
red-faced man, attired in a bright green Newmarket coat and top-boots.
</p>
<p>
"Yes, sir. Mr. Lawless told me your governor was gone to town, so I kept
him in, thinking perhaps you would want him."
</p>
<p>
"That's all right," said Coleman; "and here's my friend, Mr. Fairlegh,
will want a nag too."
</p>
<p>
"Proud to serve any gent as is a friend of yours, Mr. Coleman," replied
Snaffles, with a bob of his head towards me, intended as a bow. "What
stamp of horse do you like, sir? Most of my cattle are out with the
harriers to-day."
</p>
<p>
"Snaffles&mdash;a word with you," interrupted Cumberland.
</p>
<p>
"One moment, sir," said Snaffles to me, as he crossed over to where
Cumberland was standing.
</p>
<p>
"Come and look at Punch; and let's hear what you think of him," said
Coleman, drawing me towards the stable.
</p>
<p>
"What does Cumberland want with that man?" asked I.
</p>
<p>
"What, Snaffles? I fancy he owes a bill here, and I daresay it is
something about that."
</p>
<p>
"Oh, is that all?" rejoined I.
</p>
<p>
"Why, what did you think it was?" inquired Coleman.
</p>
<p>
"Never mind," I replied; "let's look at Punch."
</p>
<p>
And accordingly I was introduced to a little fat, round, jolly-looking
cob, about fourteen hands high, who appeared to me an equine counterpart
of Coleman himself. After having duly praised and patted him I turned to
leave the stable, just as Cumberland and Snaffles were passing the door,
and I caught the following words from the latter, who appeared rather
excited:&mdash;
</p>
<p>
"Well, if any harm comes of it, Mr. Cumberland, you'll remember it's
your doing, not mine".
</p>
<p>
Cumberland's reply was inaudible, and Snaffles turned to me, saying:&mdash;
</p>
<p>
"I've only one horse at home likely to suit you, sir; you'll find her
rather high-couraged, but Mr. Cumberland tells me you won't mind that".
</p>
<p>
"I have been mentioning what a good rider you <i>say</i> you are," said
Cumberland, laying a slight emphasis on the say.
</p>
<p>
"Oh, I daresay she will do very well," replied I. "I suppose she has no
vice about her."
</p>
<p>
"Oh dear, no," said Snaffles, "nothing of the sort.&mdash;James," added
he, calling to a helper, "saddle the chestnut mare, and bring her out
directly."
</p>
<p>
The man whom he addressed, and who was a fellow <span class="pagenum">[37]</span>with a
good-humoured, honest face, became suddenly grave, as he replied in a
deprecatory tone:&mdash;
</p>
<p>
"The chestnut mare? Mad Bess, sir?"
</p>
<p>
"Don't repeat my words, but do as you are told," was the answer; and the
man went away looking surly.
</p>
<p>
After the interval of a few minutes a stable door opposite was thrown
open, and Mad Bess made her appearance, led by two grooms. She was a
bright chestnut, with flowing mane and tail, about fifteen-and-a-half
hands high, nearly thorough-bred, and as handsome as a picture; but the
restless motion of her eye disclosing the white, the ears laid back at
the slightest sound, and a half-frightened, half-wild air, when any one
went up to her, told a tale as to her temper, about which no one in the
least accustomed to horses could doubt for an instant.
</p>
<p>
"That mare is vicious," said I, as soon as I had looked at her.
</p>
<p>
"Oh dear, no, sir, quiet as a lamb, I can assure you. Soh, girl! soh!"
said Snaffles, in a coaxing tone of voice, attempting to pat her; but
Bess did not choose to "soh," if by "sohing" is meant, as I presume,
standing still and behaving prettily; for on her master's approach she
snorted, attempted to rear, and ran back, giving the men at her head as
much as they could do to hold her.
</p>
<p>
"She's a little fresh to-day; she was not out yesterday, but it's all
play, pretty creature! nothing but play," continued Snaffles.
</p>
<p>
"If you are afraid, Fairlegh, don't ride her," said Cumberland; "but I
fancied from your conversation you were a bold rider, and did not mind a
little spirit in a horse: you had better take her in again, Snaffles."
</p>
<p>
"Leave her alone," cried I, quickly (for I was becoming irritated by
Cumberland's sneers, in spite of my attempt at self-control), "I'll
ride her. I'm no more afraid than other people; nor do I mind a
spirited horse, Cumberland; but that mare is more than spirited, she's
ill-tempered&mdash;look at her eye!"
</p>
<p>
"Well, you had better not ride her, then," said Cumberland.
</p>
<p>
"Yes, I will," answered I, for I was now thoroughly roused, and
determined to go through with the affair, at all hazards. I was always,
even as a boy, of a determined, or, as ill-natured people would call it,
obstinate disposition, and I doubt whether I am entirely cured of the
fault at the present time.
</p>
<p>
"Please yourself; only mind, I have warned you not to ride her if you
are afraid," said Cumberland.
</p>
<p>
<span class="pagenum">[38]</span>"A nice warning," replied I, turning away;&mdash;"who'll lend me a pair
of spurs?"
</p>
<p>
"I've got a pair here, sir; if you'll step this way I'll put them on for
you," said the man whom I had heard addressed as "James,"&mdash;adding, in a
lower tone, as he buckled them on, "for Heaven's sake, young gentleman,
don't mount that mare unless you're a first-rate rider."
</p>
<p>
"Why, what's the matter with her? does she kick?" inquired I.
</p>
<p>
"She'll try and pitch you off, if possible, and if she can't do that,
she'll bolt with you, and then the Lord have mercy upon you!"
</p>
<p>
This was encouraging, certainly!
</p>
<p>
"You are an honest fellow, James," replied I; "and I am much obliged to
you. Ride her I must, my honour is at stake, but I'll be as careful as I
can, and, if I come back safe, you shall have half a crown."
</p>
<p>
"Thank you, sir," was the reply, "I shall be glad enough to see you come
back in any other way than on a shutter, without the money."
</p>
<p>
Of a truth, the race of Job's comforters is not yet extinct, thought I,
as I turned to look for Coleman, who had been up to this moment employed
in superintending the operation of saddling Punch, and now made his
appearance, leading that renowned steed by the bridle.
</p>
<p>
"Why, Fairlegh, you are not going to ride that vicious brute to be sure;
even Lawless won't mount her, and he does not care what he rides in
general."
</p>
<p>
"Nevermind about Lawless," said I, assuming an air of confidence I was
very far from feeling; "she won't eat me, I daresay."
</p>
<p>
"I don't know that," rejoined Coleman, regarding Mad Bess with a look of
horror; "Cumberland, don't let him mount her."
</p>
<p>
"Nay, I can't prevent it; Fairlegh is his own master, and must do as he
likes," was the answer.
</p>
<p>
"Come, we can't keep the men standing here the whole day," said I to
Coleman; "mount Punch, and get out of my way as fast as you can, if you
are going to do so at all"&mdash;a request with which, seeing I was quite
determined, he at length unwillingly complied, and having, after one or
two failures, succeeded in throwing his leg over the cob's broad back,
rode slowly out of the yard, and took up his station outside in order to
witness my proceedings.
</p>
<p>
"Now, then," said I, "keep her as steady as you can for a minute, and as
soon as I am fairly mounted give her her head&mdash;stand clear there."
</p>
<p>
<span class="pagenum">[39]</span>I then took a short run, and, placing one hand on the saddle, while
I seized a lock of the mane with the other, I sprang from the ground and
vaulted at once upon her back, without the aid of the stirrup, a feat I
had learned from a groom who once lived with us, and which stood me in
good stead on the present occasion, as I thereby avoided a kick with
which Mad Bess greeted my approach. I next took up the reins as gently
as I could, the men let go her head, and after a little plunging and
capering, though much less than I had expected, her ladyship gave up
hostilities for the present, and allowed me to ride her quietly up
and down the yard. I then wished Cumberland (who looked, as I thought,
somewhat mortified) a good-afternoon, turned a deaf ear to the eulogies
of Mr. Snaffles and his satellites, and proceeded to join Coleman. As I
left the yard my friend James joined me, under the pretence of arranging
my stirrup leather, when he took the opportunity of saying:&mdash;
</p>
<p>
"She'll go pretty well now you're once mounted, sir, as long as you can
hold her with the snaffle, but if you are obliged to use the curb&mdash;look
out for squalls!!!"

<h2>
    CHAPTER V &mdash; MAD BESS
</h2>
<pre>
          "Away, away, my steed and I,
          Upon the pinions of the wind,
          All human dwellings left behind,
          We sped like meteors through the sky,

          With glossy skin and dripping mane,
          And reeling limbs, and reeking flank,
          The wild steed's sinewy nerves still strain
          Up the repelling bank.

          We gained the top, a boundless plain
          Spreads onward.

          My heart turned sick, my brain grew sore,
          And throbbed awhile, then beat no more,
          The sky spun like a mighty wheel,
          And a slight flash sprang o'er my eyes,
          Which saw no farther."

          <i>Mazeppa</i>.
</pre>
<p>
OUT of consideration for the excitable disposition of Mad Bess we took
our way along the least bustling streets we could select; directing our
course towards the outskirts of the town, behind which extended for some
miles a <span class="pagenum">[40]</span>portion of the range of hills known as the South Downs,
over the smooth green turf of which we promised ourselves a canter. As
we rode along Coleman questioned me as to what could have passed while
he was seeing Punch saddled, to make me determine to ride the chestnut
mare, whose vicious disposition was, he informed me, so well known, that
not only would no one ride her who could help it, but that Snaffles, who
was most anxious to get rid of her, had not as yet been able to find
a purchaser. In reply to this I gave him a short account of what had
occurred, adding my more than suspicion that the whole matter had been
arranged by Cumberland, in which notion he entirely agreed with me.
</p>
<p>
"I was afraid of something of this sort, when I said I was sorry you had
made that remark about cheating to him this morning&mdash;you see, he would
no doubt suppose you had heard the particulars of his gambling affair,
and meant to insult him by what you said, and he has done this out of
revenge. Oh, how I wish we were safely at home again; shall we turn back
now?"
</p>
<p>
"Not for the world," said I&mdash;"you will find, when you know me better,
that when once I have undertaken a thing, I <i>will</i> go through with
it&mdash;difficulties only make me more determined."
</p>
<p>
"Ah!" said Coleman, "you should get somebody to write a book about
you, that is the kind of disposition they always give to the heroes of
novels, the sort of character that will go and run his head against a
brick wall to prove that it is the harder and thicker of the two&mdash;they
knock out their brains though, sometimes, in doing it, when they happen
to have any&mdash;it is very pretty to read about, splendid in theory, but I
much doubt its acting so well if you come to put it in practice."
</p>
<p>
"You may laugh at me, if you please," replied I; "but depend upon it,
a man of energy and determination will undertake great deeds, aye, and
perform them too, which your prudent, cautious character would have
considered impossibilities."
</p>
<p>
"Perhaps it may be so," was the reply; "I know I am not the sort of
stuff they cut heroes out of&mdash;woa, Punch! steady, old boy; holloa, what
ails him? this is getting serious."
</p>
<p>
During this conversation we had been gradually leaving the town behind
us and approaching the downs, and had arrived at a point where the road
became a mere cart-track, and the open country lay spread for
miles before us. Our two steeds, which had up to the present time
<span class="pagenum">[41]</span>conducted themselves with the greatest propriety, now began to show
signs of excitement, and, as the fresh air from the downs blew against
their nostrils, they tossed their heads, snorted, and exchanged the
quiet jog-trot pace at which we had been proceeding, for a dancing,
sidelong motion, which somewhat disturbed Coleman's equanimity, and
elicited from him the expressions above recorded. The road at the same
time becoming uneven and full of ruts, we agreed to turn our horses'
heads, and quit it for the more tempting pathway afforded by the
green-sward. No sooner, however, did Punch feel the change from the
hard road to the soft elastic footing of the turf, than he proceeded to
demonstrate his happiness by slightly elevating his heels and popping
his head down between his forelegs, thereby jerking the rein loose in
Coleman's hand; and, perceiving that his rider (who was fully employed
in grasping the pommel of his saddle in order to preserve his seat)
made no effort to check his vivacity, he indulged his high spirits still
further by setting off at a brisk canter.
</p>
<p>
"Pull him in," cried I, "you'll have him run away with you; pull at
him."
</p>
<p>
Whether my advice was acted upon or not I was unable to observe, as
my whole attention was demanded by Mad Bess, who appeared at length
resolved to justify the propriety of her appellation. Holding her in by
means of the snaffle alone had been quite as much as I had been able to
accomplish during the last ten minutes, and this escapade on the part of
Punch brought the matter to a crisis. I must either allow her to follow
him, i.e., to run away, or use the curb to prevent it. Seating myself,
therefore, as firmly as I could, and gripping the saddle tightly with my
knees, I took up the curb rein, which till now had been hanging loosely
on the mare's neck, and gradually tightened it. This did not, for a
moment, seem to produce any effect, but as soon as I drew the rein
sufficiently tight to check her speed, she stopped short, and shook
her head angrily. I attempted gently to urge her on&mdash;not a step except
backwards would she stir&mdash;at length in despair I touched her slightly
with the spur, and then "the fiend within her woke," and proceeded to
make up for lost time with a vengeance. The moment the mare felt the
spur she reared until she stood perfectly erect, and fought the air with
her forelegs. Upon this I slackened the rein, and, striking her over the
ears with my riding-whip, brought her down again;&mdash;no sooner, however,
had her forefeet touched the ground than she gave <span class="pagenum">[42]</span>two or three
violent plunges, which nearly succeeded in unseating me, jerked down her
head so suddenly as to loosen the reins from my grasp, kicked viciously
several times, and, seizing the cheek of the bit between her teeth so
as to render it utterly useless (evidently an old trick of hers), sprang
forward at a wild gallop. The pace at which we were going soon brought
us alongside of Punch, who, having thoroughly mastered his rider,
considered it highly improper that any steed should imagine itself able
to pass him, and therefore proceeded to emulate the pace of Mad Bess.
Thereupon a short but very spirited race ensued, the cob's pluck
enabling him to keep neck and neck for a few yards; but the mare was
going at racing speed, and the length of her stride soon began to tell;
Punch, too, showed signs of having nearly had enough of it. I therefore
shouted to Coleman as we were leaving them: "Keep his head up hill, and
you'll be able to pull him in directly". His answer was inaudible, but
when 1 turned my head two or three minutes afterwards I was glad to see
that he had followed my advice with complete success&mdash;Punch was standing
still, about half a mile off, while his rider was apparently watching my
course with looks of horror. All anxiety on his account being thus at
an end, I proceeded to take as calm a view of my own situation as
circumstances would allow, in order to decide on the best means of
extricating myself therefrom. We had reached the top of the first range
of hills I have described, and were now tearing at a fearful rate down
the descent on the opposite side. It was clear that the mare could not
keep up the pace at which she was going for any length of time: still
she was in first-rate racing condition, not an ounce of superfluous
flesh about her, and, though she must have gone more than two miles
already, she appeared as fresh as when we started. I therefore cast my
eyes around in search of some obstacle which might check her speed. The
slope down which we were proceeding extended for about a mile before us,
after which the ground again began to rise. In the valley between the
two hills was a small piece of cultivated land, enclosed (as is usual in
the district I am describing) within a low wall, built of flint-stones
from the beach. Towards this I determined to guide the mare as well as
I was able, in the hope that she would refuse the leap, in which case
I imagined I might pull her in. The pace at which we were going soon
brought us near the spot, when I was glad to perceive that the wall was
a more formidable obstacle than I had at first imagined, being fully
six feet high, with a ditch in <span class="pagenum">[43]</span>front of it. I therefore selected a
place where the ditch seemed widest, got her head up by sawing her mouth
with the snaffle, and put her fairly at it. No sooner did she perceive
the obstacles before her than, slightly moderating her pace, she
appeared to collect herself, gathered her legs well under her, and,
rushing forward, cleared wall, ditch, and at least seven feet of ground
beyond, with a leap like a deer, alighting safely with me on her back on
the opposite side, where she continued her course with unabated vigour.
</p>
<p>
We had crossed the field (a wheat stubble) ere I had recovered from my
astonishment at finding myself safe, after such a leap as I had most
assuredly never dreamt of taking. Fortunately there was a low gate on
the farther side, towards which I guided the mare, for though I could
not check, I was in some measure able to direct, her course. This time,
however, she either did not see the impediment in her way, or despised
it, as, without abating her speed, she literally rushed through the
gate, snapping into shivers with her chest the upper bar, which was
luckily rotten, and clearing the lower ones in her stride. The blow,
and the splintered wood flying about her ears, appeared to frighten
her afresh, and she tore up the opposite ascent, which was longer and
steeper than the last, like a mad creature. I was glad to perceive,
however, that the pace at which she had come, and the distance (which
must have been several miles), were beginning to tell&mdash;her glossy coat
was stained with sweat and dust, while her breath, drawn with short
and laboured sobs, her heaving flanks, and the tremulous motion of
her limbs, afforded convincing proofs that the struggle could not be
protracted much longer. Still she continued to hold the bit between her
teeth as firmly as though it were in a vice, rendering any attempt to
pull her in utterly futile. We had now reached the crest of the hill,
when I was not best pleased to perceive that the descent on the
other side was much more precipitous than any I had yet met with. I
endeavoured, therefore, to pull her head round, thinking it would be
best to try and retrace our steps, but I soon found that it was useless
to attempt it. The mare had now become wholly unmanageable; I could not
guide her in the slightest decree; and, though she was evidently getting
more and more exhausted, she still continued to gallop madly forwards,
as though some demon had taken possession of her, and was urging her
on to our common destruction. As we proceeded down the hill our speed
increased from the force of gravitation, till we actually seemed to
<span class="pagenum">[44]</span>fly&mdash;the wind appeared to shriek as it rushed past my ears, while,
from the rapidity with which we were moving, the ground seemed to glide
from under us, till my head reeled so giddily that I was afraid I should
fall from the saddle.

</center>

<p>
We had proceeded about half way down the descent when, on passing one
or two stunted bushes which had concealed the ground beyond, I saw, oh,
horror of horrors! what appeared to be the mouth of an old chalk-pit,
stretching dark and unfathomable right across our path, about 300 yards
before us. The mare perceives it when too late, attempts to stop, but
from the impetus with which she is going is unable to do so. Another
moment, and we shall be over the brink! With the energy of despair I
lifted her with the rein with both hands, and drove the spurs madly into
her flanks;&mdash;she rose to the leap, there was a bound! a sensation of
flying through the air! a crash! and I found myself stretched in safety
on the turf beyond, and Mad Bess lying, panting, but uninjured beside
me.
</p>
<p>
To spring upon my feet, and seize the bridle of the mare, who had also
by this time recovered her footing, was the work of a moment. I then
proceeded to look around, in order to gain a more clear idea of the
situation in which I was placed, in the hope of discovering the easiest
method of extricating myself from it. Close behind me lay the chalk-pit,
and, as I gazed down its rugged sides, overgrown with brambles and rank
weeds, I shuddered to think of the probable fate from which I had been
so almost miraculously preserved, and turned away with a heartfelt
expression of thanksgiving to Him who had mercifully decreed that the
thread of my young life should not be snapped in so sudden and fearful
a manner. Straight before me the descent became almost suddenly
precipitous, but a little to the right I perceived a sort of
sheep-track, winding downwards round the side of the hill. It was a
self-evident fact that this must lead somewhere, and, as all places were
alike to me, so that they contained any human beings who were able and
willing to direct me towards Helmstone, I determined to follow it. After
walking about half a mile, Mad Bess (with her ears drooping, and her
nose nearly touching the ground) following me as quietly as a dog, I was
rejoiced by the sight of curling smoke, and, on turning a corner, I
came suddenly upon a little village green, around which some half dozen
cottages were scattered at irregular distances. I directed my steps
towards one of these, before which a <span class="pagenum">[45]</span>crazy sign, rendered by age
and exposure to the weather as delightfully vague and unintelligible
as though it had come fresh from the brush of Turner himself, hung
picturesquely from the branch of an old oak.
</p>
<p>
The sound of horse's feet attracted the attention of an elderly man, who
appeared to combine in his single person the offices of ostler, waiter,
and boots, and who, as soon as he became aware of my necessities,
proceeded to fulfil the duties of these various situations with the
greatest alacrity. First (as of the most importance in his eyes) he
rubbed down Mad Bess, and administered some refreshment to her in the
shape of hay and water; then he brought me a glass of ale, declaring it
would do me good (in which, by the way, he was not far from right). He
then brushed from my coat certain stains which I had contracted in my
fall, and finally told me my way to Helmstone. I now remounted Mad
Bess, who, though much refreshed by the hay and water, still continued
perfectly quiet and tractable; and, setting off at a moderate trot,
reached the town, after riding about eight miles, without any further
adventure, in rather less than an hour.
</p>
<p>
As I entered the street in which Snaffles' stables were situated I
perceived Coleman and Lawless standing at the entrance of the yard,
evidently awaiting my arrival.
</p>
<p>
When I got near them Coleman sprang eagerly forward to meet me,
saying:&mdash;
</p>
<p>
"How jolly glad I am to see you safe again, old fellow! I was so
frightened about you. How did you manage to stop her?"
</p>
<p>
"Why, Fairlegh, I had no idea you were such a rider," exclaimed Lawless;
"I made up my mind you would break your neck, and old Sam be minus a
pupil, when I heard you were gone out on that mare. You have taken the
devil out of her somehow, and no mistake; she's as quiet as a lamb,"
added he, patting her.
</p>
<p>
"You were very near being right," replied I; "she did her best to break
my neck and her own too, I can assure you"
</p>
<p>
I then proceeded to relate my adventures, to which both Lawless and
Coleman listened with great attention; the former interrupting me every
now and then with various expressions of commendation, and when I had
ended he shook me warmly by the hand, saying:&mdash;
</p>
<p>
"I give you great credit; you behaved in a very plucky manner all
through; I didn't think you had it in you; 'pon my word, I didn't. I
shall just tell Cumberland and <span class="pagenum">[46]</span>Snaffles a bit of my mind, too.
Here, Snaffles, you confounded old humbug, where are you?"
</p>
<p>
"Oh, don't say anything to him," said I; "it's never worth while being
angry with people of that kind; besides, Cumberland made him do it."
</p>
<p>
"That does not signify; he knew the danger to which he was exposing you,
perhaps better than Cumberland did. He had no business to do it, and
I'll make him beg your pardon before We leave this yard. Here, you
ostler fellow, where's your master?" shouted Lawless, as he turned into
the yard, where I soon heard the loud tones of his voice engaged in
angry colloquy with Snaffles, whose replies were inaudible.
</p>
<p>
In a short time the latter approached the spot where I was standing, and
began a very long and humble apology, saying that he should never have
thought of giving me the mare if he had not seen at a glance that I
was a first-rate rider, and much more to the same purpose, when Lawless
interrupted him with:&mdash;
</p>
<p>
"There, cut it short; Mr. Fairlegh does not want any more of your
blarney; and mind, if anything of the sort occurs again, I shall hire my
horses somewhere else, and take care to let all my friends know why I do
so. Now, let's be off; it's getting near dinner-time."
</p>
<p>
So saying, he turned to leave the yard, a movement which, as soon as
I had found my friend James, returned his spurs, and given him the
promised half-crown, I proceeded to imitate: and that ended the episode
of Mad Bess.

<h2>
    CHAPTER VI &mdash; LAWLESS GETS THOROUGHLY PUT OUT
</h2>
<h3>

<pre>
          ..." What 'tis
          To Have a stranger come&mdash;
          It seems you know him not
          No, sir! not I."
          &mdash;Southey.

          "Either forbear... or resolve you
          For more amazement: if you can behold it,
          I'll make the statue move indeed."
          &mdash;Winter's Tale.

          "Since the youth will not be entreated, his own peril on his
          forwardness....   You shall try but one fall."
          &mdash;<i>As You Like It</i>.
</pre>
<p>
ON reaching home the door was opened by Thomas, who accosted us with:&mdash;
</p>
<p>
"Here's such a bit of fun, gentlemen! The new pupil's arrived, and ain't
he a rum un, jest? Oh, I never!"
</p>
<p>
<span class="pagenum">[47]</span>"Why, how do you mean? what's he like, then?" asked Lawless.
</p>
<p>
"Oh, he's very well to look at, only he's as tall as a life-guardsman;
but he's sich a free and easy chap, and ain't he got a pretty good
notion of making himself comfortable, too!&mdash;that's all. But come in,
gents, you'll soon see what I mean. He chucked the flyman who brought
him here half a guinea, and when I asked him if he did not want the
change, for the fare was only half a crown, he merely said 'Pooh!' and
told me not to talk, for it tired him."
</p>
<p>
With our feelings of curiosity somewhat excited by this account we
hastened into the pupils' room, anxious to behold the individual who had
so greatly astonished Thomas.
</p>
<p>
Seated in Dr. Mildman's arm-chair, and with his legs resting upon two
other chairs, so arranged as to form a temporary sofa, reclined a young
man, apparently about eighteen, though his length of limb, and the
almost herculean proportions of his chest and shoulders, seemed rather
to belong to a more advanced age. He raised his head as we entered,
disclosing a set of features which, in spite of an expression of languor
and indifference, must have been pronounced unusually handsome. His
complexion was a rich nut-brown; the high forehead, white as snow,
contrasting well with the dark hue of his hair, which, in short
clustering curls, harmonised well with the classical outline of his
head, reminding one involuntarily of the young Antinous. The short
curling upper-lip, and well-chiselled nostril, told a tale of pride and
resolution, strongly at variance with the mild sleepy appearance of the
large dark hazel eyes, to which the long silken lashes that shaded them
imparted an almost feminine expression. He did not attempt to alter his
position as we approached, but, merely turning his head, gazed at us
steadfastly for a moment, and then observed in a slow, half-absent
manner:&mdash;
</p>
<p>
"Oh, the other pupils, I suppose&mdash;how do you do, all of you?"
</p>
<p>
Lawless, who was foremost, was so much surprised, and so little pleased
at this nonchalant style of address, that he made no reply, but turning
on his heel proceeded to leave the room, in order to divest himself of
his hunting costume, muttering as he went, "Cool enough that, by Jove,
eh!"
</p>
<p>
The duty of doing the polite having thus devolved upon Coleman, he
winked at me by way of preliminary, and, <span class="pagenum">[48]</span>making a low bow in the
true dancing-master style, replied as follows:&mdash;
</p>
<p>
"Your penetration has not erred, Mr. Oaklands; we <i>are</i> the other
pupils; and in answer to your obliging inquiries, I have much pleasure
in informing you that we are all in perfect health and very tolerable
spirits; and now, sir, in return for your kind condescension, allow me,
in the absence of my superiors, to express a hope that you are feeling
pretty comfortable&mdash;ahem!"
</p>
<p>
Having thus delivered himself, Coleman drew up his figure to its utmost
height, and, folding his arms with an air of pompous dignity, awaited an
answer.
</p>
<p>
"Oh yes, I'm comfortable enough," was the reply; "I always am; only I'm
so done up, tired as a dog&mdash;the least thing fatigues me; I'm as weak as
a rat! Don't they give you sofas here, Mr. What's-your-name?"
</p>
<p>
"My name is Norval&mdash;I mean Coleman; my father divides his time between
feeding his flocks on the Grampian Hills, and fleecing his clients in
Lincoln's Inn; though I must confess that ever since I can remember, he
has dropped the shepherd, and stuck to the solicitor, finding it pays
best, I suppose. Regarding the sofa, we have not one at present, but Dr.
Mildman went to town this morning; I did not till this moment know why.
But now I see it all&mdash;he was doubtless aware you would arrive to-day,
and, finding he could not get a sufficiently comfortable sofa for you
in Helmstone, he is gone to London on purpose to procure one. There is
still time to write by the post, if there is any particular way in which
you would like to have the stuffing arranged."
</p>
<p>
This speech made Oaklands raise his head, and look Coleman so fixedly in
the face, with such a clear, earnest, penetrating gaze, that it appeared
as if he would read his very soul. Having apparently satisfied himself,
he smiled slightly, resumed his former attitude, and observed in the
same half-sleepy tone:&mdash;
</p>
<p>
"No, I'll leave all that to him; I am not particular. What time do you
dine here?"
</p>
<p>
I replied (for the look I have described seemed to have had the
wonderful effect of silencing Coleman), "At five o'clock".
</p>
<p>
"Very good; and I believe there's a Mrs. Mildman, or some such person,
is there not? I suppose one must dress. Will you be so kind as to tell
the servant to bring some hot water, and to look out my things for me at
a quarter before five? I hate to be obliged to hurry, it tires one so."
</p>
<p>
<span class="pagenum">[49]</span>Having said this, he took up a book which was lying by his side,
and, murmuring something about "talking being so fatiguing," soon became
buried in its contents.
</p>
<p>
Whilst I was dressing for dinner Lawless came into my room, and told me
that he had been speaking to Cumberland with regard to the way in which
he had behaved to me about the mare, and that Cumberland professed
himself exceedingly sorry that the affair had so nearly turned out a
serious one, declaring he meant it quite as a joke, never expecting that
when I saw the mare I should venture to mount her.
</p>
<p>
"So you see," continued Lawless, "he merely wanted to have a good laugh
at you&mdash;nothing more. It was a thoughtless thing to do, but not so bad
as you had fancied it, by any means."
</p>
<p>
"Well," replied I, "as he says so, I am bound to believe him; but his
manner certainly gave me the impression that he intended me to ride her.
He went the right way to make me do so, at all events, by hinting that I
was afraid."
</p>
<p>
"Ah! he could not know that by intuition, you see," said Lawless; "he
thought, I daresay, as I did, that you were a mere molly-coddle, brought
up at your mother's apron-string, and had not pluck enough in you to do
anything sporting."
</p>
<p>
"It's not worth saying anything more about," replied I; "it will never
happen again: I am very much obliged to you, though."
</p>
<p>
"Oh, that's nothing," said Lawless; "if Cumberland had really meant to
break your neck, I should have fallen out with him; that would have been
too much of a good thing: however, as it is it's all right."
</p>
<p>
And so the conversation ended, though I felt far from satisfied in my
own mind as to the innocence of Cumberland's intentions.
</p>
<p>
On reaching the drawing-room I found the whole party assembled with the
exception of Mr. Henry Oaklands, who had not yet made his appearance.
At the moment of my entrance Mrs. Mildman, who had not seen the new
arrival, and who, like the rest of her sex, was somewhat curious, was
examining Coleman (who stood bolt upright before her, with his hands
behind him, looking like a boy saying his lesson) as to his manners and
appearance.
</p>
<p>
"Very tall, and dark hair and large eyes," continued Mrs. Mildman; "why,
he must be very handsome."
</p>
<p>
"He seems as if he were half-asleep," observed I.
</p>
<p>
<span class="pagenum">[50]</span>"Not always," said Coleman; "did you see the look he gave me? he
seemed wide-awake enough then; I thought he was going to eat me."
</p>
<p>
"Dear me I why he must be quite a cannibal! besides, I don't think you
would be at all nice to eat, Mr. Coleman," said Mrs. Mildman, with a
smile.
</p>
<p>
"Horrid nasty, I'm sure," muttered Mullins, who was seated on the very
edge of his chair, and looked thoroughly uncomfortable, as was his wont
in anything like civilised society.
</p>
<p>
At this moment the door opened, and Oaklands entered. If one had doubted
about his height before, when lying on the chairs, the question was set
at rest the instant he was seen standing: he must have measured at
least six feet two inches, though the extreme breadth of his chest
and shoulders, and the graceful setting-on of his finely formed
head, together with the perfect symmetry and proportion of his limbs,
prevented his appearing too tall. He went through the ceremony of
introduction with the greatest ease and self-possession; and though he
infused rather more courtesy into his manner towards Mrs. Mildman
than he had taken the trouble to bestow on us, his behaviour was still
characterised by the same indolence and listlessness I had previously
noticed, and which indeed seemed part and parcel of himself. Having
bowed slightly to Cumberland and Lawless he seated himself very
leisurely on the sofa by Mrs. Mildman's side, altering one of the
pillows so as to make himself thoroughly comfortable as he did so.
Having settled it to his satisfaction, he addressed Mrs. Mildman with:&mdash;
</p>
<p>
"What a very fatiguing day this has been; haven't you found it so?"
</p>
<p>
"No, I can't say I have," was the reply; "I daresay it was warm
travelling: I'm afraid, in that case, Dr. Mildman will not have a very
pleasant journey&mdash;he's gone to town to-day."
</p>
<p>
"Ah, so that short, stout young gentleman" (the first two adjectives he
pronounced very slowly and distinctly) "told me."
</p>
<p>
"Mr. Coleman," insinuated Mrs. Mildman.
</p>
<p>
"Pleasant that," whispered Coleman to me.
</p>
<p>
"Take care," replied I, "he will hear you."
</p>
<p>
"I'm afraid," continued Oaklands, "the old gentleman will be quite
knocked up. I wonder he does not make two days' journey of it."
</p>
<p>
"Dr. Mildman is not so <i>very</i> old," observed Mrs. Mildman, in rather an
annoyed tone of voice.
</p>
<p>
<span class="pagenum">[51]</span>"I really beg pardon, I scarcely know why I said it," replied
Oaklands, "only I somehow fancied all tutors were between sixty and
seventy&mdash;very absurd of me. My father sent all kind of civil messages
to the o&mdash;&mdash; to Dr. Mildman, only it is so much trouble to remember that
sort of thing."
</p>
<p>
At this point the conversation was interrupted by the announcement of
dinner. Oaklands (from whom I could not withdraw my eyes, so unlike
anything I had ever met with before was he) was evidently preparing to
hand Mrs. Mildman down to dinner, as soon as he could summon
sufficient energy to move, but, perceiving Cumberland approach her for
that purpose, he appeared to recollect himself, smiled slightly as if at
what he had been about to do, and, taking me by the arm, said:&mdash;
</p>
<p>
"Come, Master Curlylocks, you shall be my lady, and a very pretty girl
you would make, too, if you were properly bemuslined"; adding, as we
went downstairs together, "You and I shall be great friends, I'm sure;
I like your face particularly. What a lot of stairs there are in this
house! they'll tire me to death."
</p>
<p>
When we returned to the pupils' room after dinner Lawless found, lying
on the table, the note Dr. Mildman had written in such a mysterious
manner before he left home in the morning, and proceeded to open it
forthwith. Scarcely had he glanced his eye over it, when he was seized
with so violent a fit of laughter, that I expected every moment to see
him fall out of his chair. As soon as he had in some measure recovered
the power of speaking he exclaimed:&mdash;
</p>
<p>
"Here, listen to this! and tell me if it is not the very best thing you
ever heard in your lives ". He then read as follows:&mdash;
</p>
<p>
"'It is not without much pain that I bring myself to write this note;
but I feel that I should not be doing my duty towards your excellent
father, if I were to allow such extreme misconduct on the part of
his son to pass unreproved. I know not towards what scene of vulgar
dissipation you might be directing your steps, but the simple fact
(to which I was myself witness) of your leaving my house <i>in the low
disguise of a carter's smock-frock</i>, affords in itself sufficient proof
that your associates must belong to a class of persons utterly unfitted
for the companionship of a gentleman. Let me hope this hint may be
enough, and that conduct so thoroughly disgraceful in one brought up as
you have been may not occur again. I presume I need scarcely say that,
in the event of your <span class="pagenum">[52]</span>disregarding my wishes upon this point, the
only course left open to me would be to expel you, a measure to which it
would deeply grieve me to be obliged to resort.'"
</p>
<p>
His voice was here drowned by a chorus of laughter from all present
who were aware of the true state of the case, which lasted without
interruption for several minutes. At length Lawless observed:&mdash;
</p>
<p>
"I'll tell you what, it will be a death-blow to Smithson; a Macintosh
made by him to be taken for a smock-frock! he'll never recover it ".
</p>
<p>
"Mildman might well look like a thunder-cloud," said Coleman, "if that
was the notion he had got in his head; what a jolly lark, to be sure!"
</p>
<p>
"How do you mean to undeceive him?" inquired Cumberland.
</p>
<p>
"Oh, trust me for finding a way to do that," replied Lawless; "'the low
disguise of a carter's smock-frock,' indeed! What fun it would be if
he were to meet my governor in town to-day, and tell him of my evil
courses! why, the old boy would go into fits! I wonder what he means
by his 'scenes of vulgar dissipation'? I daresay he fancies me playing
all-fours with a beery coalheaver, and kissing his sooty-faced wife; or
drinking alternate goes of gin-and-water with a dustman for the purpose
of insinuating myself into the affections of Miss Cinderella Smut, his
interesting sister. By Jove! it's as good as a play!"
</p>
<p>
More laughter followed Lawless's illustration of Dr. Mildman's note.
The subject was discussed for some time, and a plan arranged for
enlightening the Doctor as to the true character of the mysterious
garment.
</p>
<p>
At length there was a pause, when I heard Coleman whisper to Lawless:&mdash;
</p>
<p>
"Thomas was pretty right in saying that new fellow knows how to make
himself comfortable, at all events".
</p>
<p>
"He's a precious deal too free and easy to please me," muttered Lawless,
in an undertone; "I shall take the liberty of seeing whether his
self-possession cannot be disturbed a little. I have no notion of such
airs. Here, Mullins!"
</p>
<p>
And laying hold of Mullins by the arm, he pulled him into a chair by
his side, and proceeded to give him some instructions in a whisper. The
subject of their remarks, Harry Oaklands, who had, on re-entering the
room, taken possession of the three chairs near the window, was still
reclining, book in hand, in the same indolent position, apparently
enjoying the beauty of the autumnal sunset, without concerning himself
in the slightest degree about anything which might be going on inside
the room.
</p>
<p>
<span class="pagenum">[53]</span>Lawless, whose proceedings I was watching with an anxious eye,
having evidently succeeded, by a judicious mixture of bullying and
cajollery, in persuading Mullins to assist him in whatever he was about
to attempt, now drew a chair to the other side of the window, and seated
himself exactly opposite to Oaklands.
</p>
<p>
"How tired riding makes a fellow! I declare I'm regularly baked, used
completely up," he observed, and then continued, glancing at Oaklands,
"Not such a bad idea, that. Mullins, give us a chair; I don't see why
elevating the extremities should not pay in my case, as well as in other
people's."
</p>
<p>
He then placed his legs across the chair which Mullins brought him, and,
folding his arms so as exactly to imitate the attitude of his opposite
neighbour, sat for some minutes gazing out of the window with a
countenance of mock solemnity. Finding this did not produce any effect
on Oaklands, who, having slightly raised his eyes when Lawless first
seated himself, immediately cast them upon the book again, Lawless
stretched himself, yawned, and once more addressed Mullins.
</p>
<p>
"Shocking bad sunset as ever I saw&mdash;it's no go staring at that. I must
have a book&mdash;give me the Byron."
</p>
<p>
To this Mullins replied that he believed Mr. Oaklands was reading it.
</p>
<p>
"Indeed! the book belongs to you, does it not?"
</p>
<p>
Mullins replied in the affirmative.
</p>
<p>
"Have you any objection to lend it to me?"
</p>
<p>
Mullins would be most happy to do so.
</p>
<p>
"Then ask the gentleman to give it to you&mdash;you have a right to do what
you please with your own property, I imagine?"
</p>
<p>
It was very evident that this suggestion was not exactly agreeable to
Mullins; and although his habitual fear of Lawless was so strong
as completely to overpower any dread of what might be the possible
consequences of his act, it was not without much hesitation that he
approached Oaklands, and asked him for the book, as he wished to lend it
to Lawless.
</p>
<p>
On hearing this Oaklands leisurely turned to the fly-leaf, and, having
apparently satisfied himself, by the perusal of the name written
thereon, that it really belonged to Mullins, handed it to him without a
word. I fancied, however, from the stern expression of his mouth and a
slight contraction of the brow, that he was not as insensible to their
impertinence as he wished to appear.
</p>
<p>
Lawless, who had been sitting during this little scene <span class="pagenum">[54]</span>with his
eyes closed, as if asleep, now roused himself, and saying, "Oh, you have
got it at last, have you?" began turning over the pages, reading aloud a
line or two here and there, while he kept up a running commentary on the
text as he did so:&mdash;
</p>
<p>
"Hum! ha! now let's see, here we are&mdash;the 'g-i-a-o-u-r,'&mdash;that's a
nice word to talk about. What does g-i-a-o-u-r spell, Mullins? You don't
know? what an ass you are, to be sure!&mdash;
</p>
<pre>
          'Fair clime, whose every season smiles
          Benignant o'er those blessed isles'&mdash;
</pre>
<p>
blessed isles, indeed; what stuff!&mdash;
</p>
<pre>
          ''Tis Greece, but living Greece no more;'
</pre>
<p>
that would do for a motto for the barbers to stick on their pots of
bear's grease!&mdash;
</p>
<pre>
          'Clime of the unforgotten brave;'
</pre>
<p>
<i>unforgotten</i>! yes, I should think so; how the deuce should they be
forgotten, when one is bored with them morning, noon, and night, for
everlasting, by old Sam, and all the other pastors and masters in the
kingdom? Hang me, if I can read this trash; the only poetry that ever
was written worth reading is 'Don Juan'."
</p>
<p>
He then flung the book down, adding:&mdash;
</p>
<p>
"It's confoundedly cold, I think. Mullins, shut that window."
</p>
<p>
This order involved more difficulties in its execution than might at
first be imagined. Oaklands, after giving up the book, had slightly
altered his position by drawing nearer the window and leaning his elbow
on the sill, so that it was impossible to shut it without obliging him
to move. Mullins saw this, and seemed for a moment inclined not to obey,
but a look and a threatening gesture from Lawless again decided him; and
with slow unwilling steps he approached the window, and laid his hand
on it, for the purpose of shutting it. As he did so, Oaklands raised his
head, and regarded him for a moment with a glance like lightning, his
large eyes glaring in the twilight like those of some wild animal, while
the red flush of anger rose to his brow, and we all expected to see him
strike Mullins to the ground. Conquering himself, however, by a powerful
effort of self-control, he folded his arms, and, turning from the
window, suffered Mullins to close it without interruption. Still I could
perceive, from <span class="pagenum">[55]</span>the distended nostril and quivering lip, that his
forbearance was almost exhausted.
</p>
<p>
"Ah, that's an improvement," said Lawless; "I was getting uncommonly
chilly. By the way, what an interesting virtue patience is; it is a
curious fact in Natural History that some of the lower animals share it
with us; for instance, there's nothing so patient as a jack-ass&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>
<p>
"Except a pig," put in Mullins; "they're uncommon&mdash;"
</p>
<p>
"Obstinate," suggested Coleman.
</p>
<p>
"Oh, ah! it's obstinate I mean," replied Mullins. "Well, you know
donkeys are obstinate, like a pig; that's what I meant."
</p>
<p>
"Don't be a fool," said Lawless. "Deuce take these chairs, I cannot make
myself comfortable anyhow&mdash;the fact is, I must have three, that's the
proper number&mdash;give me another, Mullins."
</p>
<p>
"I can't find one," was the answer; "they are all in use."
</p>
<p>
"Can't find one! nonsense," said Lawless; "here, take one of these; the
gentleman is asleep, and won't object, I daresay."
</p>
<p>
When Mullins was shutting the window his head had been so turned as
to prevent his observing the symptoms of anger in Oaklands, which
had convinced me that he would not bear trifling with much longer.
Presuming, therefore, from the success of his former attacks, that the
new pupil was a person who might be insulted with impunity, and actuated
by that general desire of retaliation, which is the certain effect
bullying produces upon a mean disposition, Mullins proceeded, <i>con
amore</i>, to fulfil Lawless's injunction. With a sudden snatch he withdrew
the centre chair, on which Oaklands' legs mainly rested, so violently
as nearly to throw them to the ground, a catastrophe which was finally
consummated by Lawless giving the other chair a push with his foot, so
that it was only by great exertion and quickness that Oaklands was able
to save himself from falling.
</p>
<p>
This was the climax; forbearance merely human could endure no
longer: Lawless had obtained his object of disturbing Harry Oaklands'
self-possession, and was now to learn the consequences of his success.
With a bound like that of an infuriated tiger, Oaklands leaped upon
his feet, and, dashing Mullins into a corner with such force that he
remained lying exactly where he fell, he sprang upon Lawless, seized him
by the collar of his coat, and after a short but severe struggle dragged
him to the <span class="pagenum">[56]</span>window, which was about eight feet from the ground,
threw it open, and taking him in his arms with as much ease as if he
had been a child flung him out. He then returned to the corner in which,
paralysed with fear, Mullins was still crouching, drew him to the spot
from whence he had removed the chair, placed him there upon his hands
and knees, and saying, in a stern voice, "If you dare to move till I
tell you, I'll throw you out of the window too," quietly resumed his
former position, with his legs resting upon Mullins' back instead of a
chair.

</center>

<p>
As soon as Coleman and I had in some degree recovered from our surprise
and consternation (for the anger of Oaklands once roused was a fearful
thing to behold), we ran to the other window, just in time to see
Lawless, who had alighted among some stunted shrubs, turn round and
shake his fist at Oaklands (who merely smiled), ere he regained his
feet, and rang the bell in order to gain admittance. A minute afterwards
we heard him stride upstairs, enter his bedroom, and close the door with
a most sonorous bang. Affairs remained in this position nearly a quarter
of an hour, no one feeling inclined to be the first to speak. At
length the silence was broken by Oaklands, who, addressing himself to
Cumberland, said:&mdash;
</p>
<p>
"I am afraid this absurd piece of business has completely marred the
harmony of the evening. Get up, Mr. Mullins," he continued, removing his
legs, and assisting him to rise; "I hope I did not hurt you just now."
</p>
<p>
In reply to this Mullins grumbled out something intended as a negative,
and, shambling across the room, placed himself in a corner, as far as
possible from Oaklands, where he sat rubbing his knees, the very image
of sulkiness and terror. Cumberland, who appeared during the whole
course of the affair absorbed in a book, though, in fact, not a single
word or look had escaped him, now came forward and apologised, in a
quiet, gentlemanly manner (which, when he was inclined, no one could
assume with greater success), for Lawless's impertinence, which had
only, he said, met with its proper reward.
</p>
<p>
"You must excuse me, Mr. Cumberland, if I cannot agree with you,"
replied Oaklands; "since I have had time to cool a little, I see the
matter in quite a different light. Mr. Lawless was perfectly right;
the carelessness of my manner must naturally have seemed as if I were
purposely giving myself airs, but I can assure you such was not the
case."
</p>
<p>
He paused for a moment, and then continued, with a half-embarrassed
smile:&mdash;
</p>
<p>
<span class="pagenum">[57]</span>"The fact is, I am afraid that I have been spoiled at home; my
mother died when I was a little child, and my dear father, having nobody
else to care about, thought, I believe, that there was no one in the
world equal to me, and that nothing was too good for me. Of course, all
our servants and people have taken their tone from him, so that I have
never had any one to say to me, 'Nay,' and am therefore not at all used
to the sort of thing. I hope I do not often lose my temper as I have
done this evening; but really Mr. Lawless appears quite an adept in the
art of ingeniously tormenting."
</p>
<p>
"I am afraid you must have found so much exertion very fatiguing,"
observed Coleman, politely.
</p>
<p>
"A fair hit, Mr. Coleman," replied Oaklands, laughing. "No! those are
not the things that tire me, somehow; but in general I am very easily
knocked up&mdash;I am indeed&mdash;most things are so much trouble, and I hate
trouble; I suppose it is that I am not strong."
</p>
<p>
"Wretchedly weak, I should say," rejoined Coleman; "it struck me that
you were so just now, when you chucked Lawless out of the window like a
cat."
</p>
<p>
"Be quiet, Freddy," said Cumberland, reprovingly.
</p>
<p>
"Nay, don't stop him," said Oaklands; "I delight in a joke beyond
measure, when I have not the trouble of making it myself. But about this
Mr. Lawless, I am exceedingly sorry that I handled him so roughly; would
you mind going to tell him so, Mr. Cumberland, and explaining that I did
not mean anything offensive by my manner?"
</p>
<p>
"Exactly, I'll make him understand the whole affair, and bring him down
with me in five minutes," said Cumberland, leaving the room as he spoke.
</p>
<p>
"What makes Cumberland so good-natured and amiable to-night?" whispered
I to Coleman.
</p>
<p>
"Can't you tell?" was the reply. "Don't you see that Oaklands is a
regular top-sawyer, a fish worth catching; and that by doing this,
Cumberland places him under an obligation at first starting? Not a bad
move to begin with, eh? Besides, if a regular quarrel between Lawless
and Oaklands were to ensue, Cumberland would have to take one side or
the other; and it would not exactly suit him to break with Lawless, he
knows too much about him; besides," added he, sinking his voice, "he
owes him money, more than I should like to owe anybody a precious deal,
I can tell you. Now, do you <i>twig</i>?"
</p>
<p>
"Yes," said I, "I comprehend the matter more clearly, if that is what
you mean by <i>twigging</i>; but how shocking <span class="pagenum">[58]</span>it all is! why, Cumberland
is quite a swindler&mdash;gambling, borrowing money he can't pay, and&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>
<p>
"Hush!" interrupted Coleman, "here they come."
</p>
<p>
Coleman was not mistaken: Cumberland had been successful in his embassy,
and now entered the room, accompanied by Lawless, who looked rather
crestfallen, somewhat angry, and particularly embarrassed and
uncomfortable, which, as Coleman whispered to me, was not to be wondered
at, considering how thoroughly he had been <i>put out</i> just before.,
Oaklands, however, appeared to see nothing of all this; but, rising from
his seat as they entered, he approached Lawless, saying:&mdash;
</p>
<p>
"This has been a foolish piece of business, Mr. Lawless; I freely own
that I am thoroughly ashamed of the part I have taken in it, and I can
only apologise for the intemperate manner in which I behaved".
</p>
<p>
The frank courtesy with which he said this was so irresistible, that
Lawless was completely overcome, and, probably for the first time in
his life, felt himself thoroughly in the wrong. Seizing Oaklands' hand,
therefore, and shaking it heartily, he replied:&mdash;
</p>
<p>
"I'll tell you what it is, Oaklands&mdash;we don't Mr. each other here&mdash;you
are a right good fellow&mdash;a regular brick, and no mistake; and as to
your shoving me out of the window, you served me quite right for my
abominable impertinence. I only wonder you did not do it ten minutes
sooner, that's all; but you really ought to be careful what you do with
those arms of yours; I was like a child in your grasp; you are as strong
as a steam engine."
</p>
<p>
"I can assure you I am not," replied Oaklands; "they never let me do
anything at home, for fear I should knock myself up."
</p>
<p>
"You are more likely to knock other people down, I should say," rejoined
Lawless; "and, by the way, that reminds me&mdash;Mullins! come here, stupid,
and beg Mr. Oaklands' pardon, and thank him for knocking you down."
</p>
<p>
A sulky, half-muttered "shan't," was the only reply.
</p>
<p>
"Nay, I don't want anything of that kind; I don't indeed, Lawless; pray
leave him alone," cried Oaklands eagerly.
</p>
<p>
But Lawless was not so easily quieted, and Oaklands, unwilling to
risk the harmony so newly established between them, did not choose to
interfere further; so Mullins was dragged across the room by the ears,
and was forced by Lawless, who stood over him with the poker (which, he
informed him, he was destined to eat red-hot if he became restive),
to make Oaklands a long and <span class="pagenum">[59]</span>formal apology, with a short form of
thanksgiving appended, for the kindness and condescension he had evinced
in knocking him down so nicely, of which oration he delivered himself
with a very bad grace indeed.
</p>
<p>
"And all went merry as a marriage-bell," until we were summoned to
the drawing-room, where we were regaled with weak tea, thin bread and
butter, and small conversation till ten o'clock, when Mrs. Mildman
proceeded to read prayers, which, being a duty she was little accustomed
to, and which consequently rendered her extremely nervous, she did
not accomplish without having twice called King William, George, and
suppressed our gracious Queen Adelaide altogether.

THE moment Dr. Mildman arrived at home the next day Lawless watched him
into his study, and, as soon as he was safely lodged therein, proceeded,
by the aid of sundry nails and loops previously placed there for the
purpose, to hang his Macintosh right across the passage, so that no
one could leave the study without running against it. He then ambushed
himself near the open door of the pupils' room, where, unseen himself,
he could observe the effect of his arrangements. Coleman and I,
also taking a lively interest in the event, ensconced ourselves in a
favourable position for seeing and hearing. After waiting till our small
stock of patience was nearly exhausted, we were rewarded by hearing the
study-door slowly open, followed by the tread of a well-known footstep
in the passage. The next sound that reached <span class="pagenum">[60]</span>our ears was a quick
shuffling of feet upon the oil-cloth, as if the person advancing had
"shyed" at some unexpected object; then came the muttered exclamation,
"Bless my heart, what's this?" And immediately afterwards Dr. Mildman's
face, wearing an expression of the most thorough perplexity and
bewilderment, appeared cautiously peeping from behind the Macintosh.
Having apparently satisfied himself that no enemy was concealed there,
and he had nothing further to fear, but that the whole plot was
centred as it were in the mysterious garment before him, he set himself
seriously to work to examine it. First he pulled out his eye-glass and,
stepping back a pace or two, took a general survey of the whole; he then
approached it again, and taking hold of it in different places with
his hand, examined it in detail so closely that it seemed as if he were
trying to count the number of threads. Being apparently unwilling in so
difficult an investigation to trust to the evidence of any one sense,
he replaced his eye-glass in his waistcoat pocket, and began rubbing
a portion of the skirt between his hands; the sense of touch failing,
however, to throw any new light upon the subject, as a sort of forlorn
hope, he applied his nose to it. The result of this was an indescribable
exclamation, expressive of intense disgust, followed immediately by a
violent sneeze; then came a long pause, as though he were considering
of what possible use such a garment could be. At length a ray of light
seemed to break in upon the darkness, and once more laying hands on the
Macintosh he proceeded, after unhooking it from the nails on which it
hung, slowly and deliberately to put it on, with the back part foremost,
somewhat after the fashion of a child's pinafore. Having at length
accomplished this difficult operation, he walked, or rather shuffled
(for his petticoats interfered greatly with the free use of his limbs),
up and down the hall, with a grave, not to say solemn, expression of
countenance. Appearing perfectly satisfied after one or two turns that
he had at last solved the enigma, he divested himself of the perplexing
garment, hung it on a peg appropriated to great-coats, and approached
the door of the pupils' room.
</p>
<p>
By the time he entered Lawless was seated at his desk studying
Herodotus, while Coleman and I were deeply immersed in our respective
Euclids.
</p>
<p>
After shaking hands with Oaklands, and addressing some good-natured
remarks to each of us in turn, he went up to Lawless, and, laying his
hand kindly on his shoulder, said, with a half-smile:&mdash;
</p>
<p>
<span class="pagenum">[61]</span>"I am afraid I have made rather an absurd mistake about that
strange garment of yours, Lawless; I suppose it is some new kind of
greatcoat, is it not?"
</p>
<p>
"Yes, sir, it is a sort of waterproof cloth, made with Indian rubber."
</p>
<p>
"Indian rubber, is it? Well, I fancied so; it has not the nicest smell
in the world. I certainly thought it was a smock-frock, though, when I
saw you go out in it. Is not it rather awkward to walk in? I found it so
when I tried it on just now, and buttoning behind does not seem to me at
all a good plan."
</p>
<p>
"No, sir, but it is meant to button in front; perhaps you put it on the
back part foremost."
</p>
<p>
"Hem!" said Dr. Mildman, trying to look as if he thought such a thing
impossible, and failing&mdash;"it is a very singular article of dress
altogether, but I am glad it was not a smock-frock you went out in. I
hope," continued he, turning to Oaklands, with an evident wish to change
the conversation, "I hope they took good care of you when you arrived
last night?"
</p>
<p>
This was turning the tables with a vengeance! Lawless became suddenly
immersed in Herodotus again.
</p>
<p>
"Oh! the greatest," was the reply; "I had so much attention paid me
that I was almost <i>upset</i> by it. I was not quite overcome, though," he
continued, with a sly glance towards Lawless, "and Mrs. Mildman gave us
some very nice tea, which soon restored me."
</p>
<p>
"Well, I'm glad they managed to make you comfortable among them,"
observed Dr. Mildman, turning over his papers and books, preparatory to
beginning the morning's study.
</p>
<p>
"Hadn't you better ask him when he expects the sofa will be down?"
suggested Coleman to Oaklands, in a whisper.
</p>
<p>
"No, you jackanapes," was the reply, "and don't you make me laugh when
that old gentleman is in the room, for there's nothing more fatiguing
than the attempt to smother a laugh."
</p>
<p>
Coleman's only answer to this, if answer it could be called, was a
grimace, which had the desired effect of throwing Oaklands into a fit of
laughter, which he found it very hard labour indeed to stifle; nor had
his countenance quite recovered from the effects of his exertions, when
he was summoned to the Doctor's table to undergo an examination similar
to that which had appeared so formidable to me a few days before; and
thus terminated the notable adventure of the carter's frock, though I
<span class="pagenum">[62]</span>observed that after a week or two had elapsed the Macintosh was
handed over to Thomas, and Smithson was called upon to tax his inventive
powers to furnish Lawless with a less questionably shaped garment of the
same material.
</p>
<p>
A few days after this, as I was walking with Coleman, he suddenly
exclaimed:&mdash;
</p>
<p>
"Well, of all the antediluvian affairs I ever beheld, the old fellow
now coming towards us is the queerest; he looks like a fossil edition
of Methuselah, dug up and modernised some hundred years ago at the very
least. Holloa! he's going mad I believe; I hope he does not bite."
</p>
<p>
The subject of these somewhat uncomplimentary remarks was a little old
gentleman in a broad-brimmed white hat, turned up with green, and a
black cloth spencer (an article much like a boy's jacket exaggerated),
from beneath which protruded the very broad tails of a blue coat, with
rather more than their proper complement of bright brass buttons, while
drab gaiters and shorts completed the costume.
</p>
<p>
The moment, however, I beheld the countenance of the individual in
question, I recognised the never-to-be-mistaken mole at the tip of
the nose of my late coach companion to London. The recognition seemed
mutual, for no sooner did he perceive me than he stopped short, and
pointed straight at me with a stout silver-mounted bamboo which he held
in his hand, uttering a sonorous "Umph!" as he did so; to which somewhat
unusual mode of salutation may be attributed Coleman's doubts as to his
sanity.
</p>
<p>
"Who'd ever have thought of meeting you at Helmstone, I should like to
know?" exclaimed he in a tone of astonishment.
</p>
<p>
"I was going to say the same thing to you, sir," replied I; "I came down
here the very day on which we travelled together."
</p>
<p>
"Umph! I came the next; well, and what are you doing now you are here?
Schoolmaster lives here, I suppose&mdash;tutor, you call him, though, don't
you?"
</p>
<p>
I informed him of my tutor's name and residence, when he continued:&mdash;
</p>
<p>
"Umph! I know him; very good man, too good to be plagued by a set of
tiresome boys&mdash;men, though, you call yourselves, don't you? Umph! Is he
a man too?" he inquired, pointing to Coleman.
</p>
<p>
"I've been a man these seventeen years, sir," replied Coleman.
</p>
<p>
<span class="pagenum">[63]</span>"Umph, a man seventeen years ago! a baby, more likely: what does he
mean? what does he mean?"
</p>
<p>
I explained that he probably intended a pun upon his name, which was
Coleman.
</p>
<p>
"A pun, Umph? he makes puns, does he? funny boy, funny boy, I daresay.
How does the Doctor like that, though? Make puns to him, he'd <i>pun</i>ish
you, Umph? Stupid things puns&mdash;made one myself then, though&mdash;just like
me. Well, give the Doctor my compliments&mdash;Mr. Frampton's&mdash;I live at No.
10 Castle Street,&mdash;he knows me, and ask him to let you come and dine
with me next week; bring funny boy too, if he likes to come;" and away
he posted, muttering "Umph! plaguing myself about a pack of boys, when I
might be quiet&mdash;just like me!"
</p>
<p>
We did not fail to deliver Mr. Frampton's message to Dr. Mildman on our
return home, who willingly gave us the required permission, saying
that he knew but little of the old gentleman personally, though he had
resided for several years at Helmstone, but that he was universally
respected, in spite of his eccentricities, and was reported to have
spent great part of his life abroad. The next time I met my new friend
he repeated his invitation to Coleman and myself, and, on the day
appointed, gave us an excellent dinner, with quite as much wine as we
knew what to do with; amused and interested us with sundry well-told
anecdotes of adventures he had met with during his residence in foreign
lands, and dismissed us at nine o'clock with a tip of a guinea each, and
an injunction to come and see him again whenever we pleased.
</p>
<p>
For many succeeding weeks nothing of any particular moment occurred to
interrupt the even tenor of the new course of life I had entered upon.
The liking which Oaklands seemed to have taken to me at first sight soon
ripened into a warm friendship, which continued daily to increase on
my part, as the many noble and lovable qualities of his disposition
appeared, one by one, from behind the veil of indolence which, till one
knew him well, effectually concealed them. Coleman, though too volatile
to make a real friend of, was a very agreeable companion, and, if it
were ever possible to get him to be serious for a minute, showed that
beneath the frivolity of his manner lay a basis of clear good sense and
right feeling, which only required calling forth to render him a much
higher character than he appeared at present. For the rest, I was
alternately bullied and patronised by Lawless (though he never ventured
on the former line of conduct when Oaklands was present), while
Cumberland, outwardly <span class="pagenum">[64]</span>professing great regard for me, never let
slip an opportunity of showing me an ill-natured turn, when he could
contrive to do so without committing himself openly.
</p>
<p>
A more intimate acquaintance with Mullins only served to place beyond
a doubt the fact of his being a most unmitigated, and not over-amiable,
fool. The word is a strong one, but I fear that, if I were to use a
milder term, it would be at the expense of truth.
</p>
<p>
For my tutor I soon began to conceive the warmest feeling of regard and
esteem; in fact, it was impossible to know him well, and not to love
him. Simple as a child in everything relating to worldly matters,
he united the deepest learning to the most elevated piety, while the
thoroughly practical character of his religion, carried, as it was,
into all the minor details of everyday life, imparted a gentleness and
benignity to his manner which seemed to elevate him above the level of
ordinary mortals. If he had a fault (I suppose, merely for the sake
of proving him human, I must allow him one), it was a want of moral
courage, which made it so disagreeable to him to find fault with any of
us, that he would now and then allow evils to exist, which a little more
firmness and decision might have prevented; but, had it not been for
this, he would have been quite perfect, and perfection is a thing not to
be met with in this life.
</p>
<p>
Cumberland, after the eventful evening on which he acted as peacemaker
between Lawless and Oaklands, had persevered steadily in his endeavour
to ingratiate himself with the latter; and, by taking advantage of
his weak point, his indolence and dislike of trouble, had, at length,
succeeded in making Oaklands believe him essential to his comfort.
Thus, though there was not the smallest sympathy between them, a sort
of alliance was established, which gave Cumberland exactly the
opportunities he required for putting into execution certain schemes
which he had formed. Of what these schemes consisted, and how far they
succeeded, will appear in the course of this veracious history.
</p>
<p>
The winter months, after favouring us with rather more than our due
allowance of frost and snow, had at length passed away, and March,
having come in like a lion, appeared determined, after the fashion of
Bottom the weaver, "to roar that it would do any man's heart good to
hear him," and to kick up a thorough dust ere he would condescend to
go out like a lamb, albeit, in the latter state, he might have made
a shilling per pound of himself at any market, had he felt suicidally
inclined.
</p>
<p>
<span class="pagenum">[65]</span>"This will never do," said Oaklands to me, as, for the third time,
we were obliged to turn round and cover our eyes, to avoid being blinded
by the cloud of dust which a strong east wind was driving directly in
our faces; "there is nothing in the world tires one like walking against
a high wind. A quarter to three," added he, taking out his watch. "I
have an appointment at three o'clock. Will you walk with me? I must turn
up here."
</p>
<p>
I assented; and, turning a corner, we proceeded up a narrow street,
where the houses, in a great measure, protected us from the wind. After
walking some little distance in silence Oaklands again addressed me:&mdash;
</p>
<p>
"Frank, did you ever play at billiards?"
</p>
<p>
I replied in the negative.
</p>
<p>
"It's a game I've rather a liking for," continued he; "we have a table
at Heathfield, and my father and I often played when the weather was too
bad to get out. I used to beat the old gentleman easily though at last,
till I found out one day he did not half like it, so then I was obliged
to make shocking mistakes, every now and then, to give him a chance of
winning; anybody else would have found me out in a minute, for I am the
worst hand in the world at playing the hypocrite, but my father is the
most unsuspicious creature breathing. Oh! he is such a dear old man.
You must come and stay with us, Frank, and learn to know him and love
him&mdash;he'd delight in you&mdash;you are just the sort of fellow he likes."
</p>
<p>
"There's nothing I should like better," answered I, "if I can get
leave from head-quarters; but why did you want to know if I played at
billiards?"
</p>
<p>
"Oh, I have been playing a good deal lately with Cumberland, who
seems very fond of the game, and I'm going to meet him at the rooms in
F&mdash;&mdash;Street to-day; so I thought, if you knew anything of the game, you
might like to come with me."
</p>
<p>
"Cumberland is a first-rate player, isn't he?" asked I.
</p>
<p>
"No, I do not think so: we play very evenly, I should say; but we are to
have a regular match to-day, to decide which is the best player."
</p>
<p>
"Do you play for money?"
</p>
<p>
"Just a trifle to give an interest to the game, nothing more," replied
Oaklands; "our match to-day is for a five-pound note."
</p>
<p>
I must confess that I could not help feeling extremely uneasy at the
information Oaklands had just given me. The recollection of what Coleman
had said concerning some gaming affair in which Cumberland was supposed
<span class="pagenum">[66]</span>to have behaved dishonourably, combined with a sort of general
notion, which seemed to prevail, that he was not exactly a safe person
to have much to do with, might in some degree account for this; still
I always felt a kind of instinctive dislike and mistrust of Cumberland,
which led me to avoid him as much as possible on my own account. In the
present instance, when the danger seemed to threaten my friend, this
feeling assumed a vague character of fear; "and yet," reasoned I with
myself, "what is there to dread? Oaklands has plenty of money at his
command; besides, he says they play pretty evenly, so that he must
win nearly as often as Cumberland; then, he is older than I am, and of
course must be better able to judge what is right or wrong for him to
do." However, remembering the old adage, that "lookers-on see most of
the game," I determined, for once, to accompany him; I therefore told
him that, though I could not play myself, it would be an amusement to me
to watch them, and that, if he had no objection, I would go with him, to
which proposition he willingly agreed. As we turned into F&mdash;&mdash;Street we
were joined by Cumberland, who, as I fancied, did not seem best pleased
at seeing me, nor did the scowl which passed across his brow, on hearing
I was to accompany them, tend to lessen this impression. He did not,
however, attempt to make any opposition to the plan, merely remarking
that, as I did not play myself, he thought I should find it rather dull.
After proceeding about half way down the street Cumberland stopped in
front of a small cigar-shop, and, turning towards a private door,
on which was a brass plate with the word "Billiards" engraved on it,
knocked, and was admitted. Leading the way up a dark, narrow staircase,
he opened a green baize door at the top, and ushered us into a tolerably
large room, lighted by a sky-light, immediately under which stood the
billiard-table. On one side was placed a rack, containing a formidable
arrangement of cues, maces, etc., while at the farther end two small
dials, with a brass hand in the centre for the purpose of marking the
scores of the different players, were fixed against the wall. As we
entered, two persons who were apparently performing certain intricate
manoeuvres with the balls by way of practice immediately left off
playing and came towards us. One of these, a little man, with small keen
grey eyes, and a quick restless manner, which involuntarily reminded one
of a hungry rat, rejoiced in the name of "Slipsey," and proved to be the
billiard-marker; his <span class="pagenum">[67]</span>companion was a tall stout personage, with
a very red face, rather handsome features, large white teeth, and a
profusion of bushy whiskers, moustaches, and imperial of a dark-brown
colour. His dress consisted of a blue military frock coat, which he wore
open, to display a crimson plush waistcoat and thick gold watch-chain,
while his costume was completed by a pair of black and white plaid
trousers, made in the extreme of the fashion, with a broad stripe down
the outside of the leg. This personage swaggered up to Cumberland,
and, with a manner composed of impertinent familiarity and awkwardness,
addressed him as follows:&mdash;
</p>
<p>
"How d'ye do, Mr. Cumberland? hope I see you well, sir. Terrible bad
day, gentlemen, don't you think? dusty enough to pepper the devil, as we
used to say in Spain, hey? Going to have a touch at the rolley-polleys,
I suppose."
</p>
<p>
"We shall be disturbing you, Captain Spicer," said Cumberland, who, I
thought, had tact enough to perceive that his friend's free and easy
manner was the reverse of acceptable to Oaklands.
</p>
<p>
"Not at all, not at all," was the reply; "it was so terrible unpleasant
out of doors that, as I happened to be going by, I thought I'd look in
to see if there was anything up; and as the table was lying idle I got
knocking the balls about with little Slipsey here, just to keep one's
hand in, you know."
</p>
<p>
"Well, then, we had better begin at once," said Cumberland, to which
Oaklands assented rather coldly.
</p>
<p>
As he was pulling off his greatcoat he whispered to me, "If that man
stays here long, I shall never be able to stand it: his familiarity is
unbearable; there is nothing tires me so much as being obliged to be
civil to that kind of people".
</p>
<p>
"How is it to be?" said Cumberland, "whoever wins four games out of
seven is the conqueror, wasn't that it?"
</p>
<p>
"Yes, I believe so," was Oaklands' reply.
</p>
<p>
"A very sporting match, 'pon my life," observed the Captain; "are the
stakes high?"
</p>
<p>
"Oh no! a mere nothing: five, or ten pounds, did we say?" inquired
Cumberland.
</p>
<p>
"Just as you like," replied Oaklands, carelessly.
</p>
<p>
"Ten pounds, by all means, I should say; five pounds is so shocking
small, don't you think? not worth playing for?" said the Captain.
</p>
<p>
"Ten let it be then," said Cumberland; and after a few preliminaries
they began playing.
</p>
<p>
<span class="pagenum">[68]</span>I did not understand the game sufficiently to be able to give
a detailed account of the various chances of the match, nor would it
probably greatly interest the reader were I to do so. Suffice it, then,
to state, that, as far as I could judge, Oaklands, disgusted by the
vulgar impertinence of the Captain (if Captain he was), thought the
whole thing a bore, and played carelessly. The consequence was, that
Cumberland won the first two games. This put Oaklands upon his mettle,
and he won the third and fourth; the fifth was hardly contested,
Oaklands evidently playing as well as he was able, Cumberland also
taking pains; but it struck me as singular that, in each game, <i>his</i>
play seemed to depend upon that of his adversary. When Oaklands first
began Cumberland certainly beat him, but not by many; and, as he became
interested, and his play improved, so in the same ratio did Cumberland's
keep pace with it. Of course, there might be nothing in this; the same
causes that affected the one might influence the other; but the idea
having once occurred to me, I determined to watch the proceedings still
more closely, in order, if possible, to make up my mind on the point.
After a very close contest Oaklands also won the fifth game; in the
sixth he missed a difficult stroke, after which he played carelessly,
apparently intending to reserve his strength for the final struggle, so
that Cumberland won it easily. Each had now won three games, and on the
event of the seventh depended the match. Again did Oaklands, who was
evidently deeply interested, use his utmost skill, and his play, which
certainly was very good, called forth frequent eulogiums from the
Captain, who offered to bet unheard-of sums on the certainty of his
winning (which, as there was no one in the room at all likely to accept
his offer, was a very safe and innocent amusement), and again, <i>pari
passu</i>, did Cumberland's skill keep pace with his. After playing neck
and neck, till nearly the end of the game, Cumberland gained a slight
advantage, which produced the following state of affairs:&mdash;It was
Oaklands' turn to play, and the balls were placed in such a position,
that by a brilliant stroke he might win the game, but it required great
skill to do so. If he failed, the chances were so much in Cumberland's
favour as to render his success almost a certainty. It was an anxious
moment: for my own part, I felt as if I scarcely dared breathe, and
could distinctly hear the throbbing of my own heart, while the Captain,
after having most liberally offered to bet five hundred pounds to five
pence that he did it, remained silent and <span class="pagenum">[69]</span>motionless as a statue,
watching the proceedings, with his eye-glass screwed after some
mysterious fashion into the corner of his eye. And now, carefully and
deliberately, Oaklands pointed his cue&mdash;his elbow was drawn back for the
stroke&mdash;for the last time his eye appeared to measure and calculate
the precise spot he must strike to produce the desired effect&mdash;when
suddenly, and at the exact moment in which the cue struck the ball, a
sonorous sneeze from the rat-like billiard-marker resounded through
the room; as a necessary consequence, Oaklands gave a slight start and
missed his stroke. The confusion that ensued can "better be imagined
than described," as the newspapers always say about the return from
Epsom. With an exclamation of anger and disappointment Oaklands turned
away from the table, while the Captain began storming at Slipsey, whom
he declared himself ready to kick till all was blue, for the trifling
remuneration of half a farthing. The marker himself apologised, with
great contrition, for his delinquency, which he declared was quite
involuntary, at the same time asserting that, to the best of his belief,
the gentleman had made his stroke <i>before</i> he sneezed: this Oaklands
denied, and appealed to Cumberland for his opinion. After trying in
various ways to avoid giving a direct answer, and appealing in his turn
to Captain Spicer (who was so intensely positive that the sneeze had
preceded the stroke, that he was willing to back his opinion to any
amount), Cumberland very unwillingly owned that, if he was forced to
say what he thought, he believed Oaklands had made his stroke before the
sneeze caused him to start, but that it was a near thing, and he might
very possibly be mistaken. This was quite enough for Oaklands, who
declared that he was perfectly satisfied, and begged Cumberland to
play, which, with some apparent reluctance, he did, and, as was almost a
matter of certainty, proved the conqueror.
</p>
<p>
"'Pon my life, in all my experience, I never knew a gentleman lose a
match in such a tremendously unfortunate way," observed the Captain.
"I am certain that if you had not been flurried, Mr. Oaklands, sir, you
could have done the trick as clean as a whistle. Allow me to place the
balls as they were then&mdash;I know how they stood to a nicety&mdash;there,
that's it to a demi-semi fraction; oblige me, sir, just as a personal
favour, by trying the stroke once more."
</p>
<p>
Thus invoked, Oaklands approached the table, and, without a moment's
deliberation, struck the ball, and succeeded in doing with perfect ease
the very thing which a minute before would have won him ten pounds.
</p>
<p>
<span class="pagenum">[70]</span>"There! I was super-certain you could do it; the match was yours,
sir, as safe as the bank, if that wretched little abortion there hadn't
made that disgusting noise. Play him again, sir; play him again: Mr.
Cumberland's a pretty player, a very pretty player; but you're too
strong for him, Mr. Oaklands; it's my firm conviction you're too strong
for him."
</p>
<p>
"What do you say to giving me my revenge, Cumberland?" asked Oaklands.
</p>
<p>
"Oh! <i>I</i> can have no possible objection," replied Cumberland, with
the slightest imaginable assumption of superiority in his tone, which
annoyed my ear, and which I felt sure would produce the same effect upon
Oaklands. The next game Oaklands won; and they continued to play the
rest of the afternoon with various success, and for what appeared to me
very high stakes. I calculated that, by the time they left off, Oaklands
must have lost more than thirty pounds; and yet, in spite of this, to a
superficial observer he appeared to be the better player of the two: he
certainly made the most brilliant strokes, but he also made blunders,
and failed now and then; while Cumberland's score mounted up without
one's exactly knowing how; he never seemed to be playing particularly
well, and yet there was always something easy for him to do; while, when
Oaklands had to play, the balls got into such awkward positions that it
appeared as if they were leagued against him.
</p>
<p>
Besides this, many things concurred to strengthen me in my pre-conceived
idea, that Cumberland was accommodating his play to that of Oaklands,
whom, I felt certain, he could have beaten easily, if he had been so
inclined. If this were really the case, the only conclusion one could
come to was, that the whole thing was a regularly arranged plot: the
object of which was to win as much as he could of Oaklands' money. The
marker's sneeze too, occurring so very opportunely for Cumberland's
interest; and the presence of the Captain, who, by his eulogiums on
Oaklands' skill, had excited him to continue playing, while, by his
observations and advice, he had endeavoured (whenever it was possible)
to raise the amount of the stakes; all this favoured my view of the
case. Still these were but suspicions; for I was utterly without proof:
and could I on mere suspicion tell Oaklands that he was a dupe, and
Cumberland a knave? No, this would never do; so I determined, as people
generally do when they are at their wits' end, and can <span class="pagenum">[71]</span>hit on
nothing better, to wait and see what time would bring forth, and act
according to circumstances.
</p>
<p>
Should any of my readers think such penetration unnatural in a boy of
my age, brought up in a quiet country parsonage, let them remember that,
though utterly ignorant of the ways of the world, I was what is called
a quick, sharp boy; that I had been informed Cumberland was not a person
to be trusted, nay, that he was known to have cheated some young
man before; and that, moreover, my very unworldliness and ignorance
increased my suspicions, inasmuch as it seemed to me that playing
billiards, at a public table, for what I considered large sums of money,
was neither more nor less than gambling; and gambling I viewed in the
light of a patent twenty-devil-power man-trap, fresh baited (in the
present case with a billiard cue and balls) by the claws of the Evil
One himself; consequently, I was prepared to view everything that passed
with the greatest mistrust; and, in such a frame of mind, I must have
been blind not to have perceived something of what was going on.

<h2>
    CHAPTER VIII &mdash; GOOD RESOLUTIONS
</h2>
<pre>
          "Blest are those
          Whose blood and judgement are so well commingled,
          That they are not a pipe for Fortune's linger
          To sound what stop she please."
          &mdash;Hamlet.

          "There's a sweet little cherub that sits up aloft."
          &mdash;Naval Song.
</pre>
<p>
AS we were preparing to take our departure I observed the Captain
exchange glances with Cumberland, who turned to Oaklands, saying:&mdash;
</p>
<p>
"Don't wait for me; I have one or two places to call at in my way back,
and I shall only make you late;&mdash;when you get home, give Thomas a hint
to keep back dinner five minutes or so&mdash;old Mildman won't say anything
about it, if he fancies it's the servant's fault."
</p>
<p>
To this Oaklands replied, "that it was rather a shame, but he'd see what
he could do for once"; and, with a very distant bow to the Captain, we
left the room. As soon as we were in the street Oaklands accosted me
with:&mdash;
</p>
<p>
"Well, Frank, what do you think of billiards?"
</p>
<p>
<span class="pagenum">[72]</span>"Why," replied I, after a moment's thought, "as to the game itself,
it's a very pretty game, and when you can play well, I have no doubt a
very interesting one; too much so, perhaps."
</p>
<p>
"Too interesting! why, that's the beauty of it; almost every other
game is a bore, and tires one, because one does not get sufficiently
interested to forget the trouble of it; what can you mean by too
interesting?"
</p>
<p>
"You won't be angry at what I am going to say, will you?" said I,
looking up in his face.
</p>
<p>
"Angry with you, my dear boy! no fear of that; always say just what
you think to me, and, if it happens to be disagreeable, why it can't be
helped; I would rather hear a disagreeable truth from a friend any day,
than have it left for some ill-natured person to bring out, when he
wants to annoy me."
</p>
<p>
"All I meant to say was this," I replied; "it seems to me that you get
so much excited by the game, that you go on playing longer, and for
higher stakes, than you intended to do when you began,&mdash;surely,"
continued I, "it cannot be right to lose such sums of money merely for
amusement; is it not gambling?"
</p>
<p>
"I believe you are right, Frank," replied Oaklands, after a short pause,
during which he had apparently been revolving the matter in his mind;
"when one comes to think seriously about it, it is a most unprofitable
way of getting rid of one's money; you will scarcely credit it,"
continued he, half-smiling, "but I declare to you I have been playing
almost every day for the last two months."
</p>
<p>
"So long as that?" interrupted I, aghast.
</p>
<p>
"There or thereabouts," said Oaklands, laughing at the tone of horror in
which I had spoken; "but I was going to say," he continued, "that till
this moment&mdash;looking upon it merely as an amusement, something to keep
one from going to sleep over a newspaper in that vile reading-room&mdash;I
have never taken the trouble to consider whether there was any right or
wrong in the matter. I am very much obliged to you for the hint,
Frank; I'll think it all over to-night, and see how much I owe Master
Cumberland, and I'll tell you to-morrow what conclusion I have come to.
I hate to do anything in a hurry&mdash;even to think; one must take time to
do that well."
</p>
<p>
We had now reached home, and, mindful of his promise, Oaklands begged
Thomas to use his interest with the cook, for the purpose of postponing
dinner for a few <span class="pagenum">[73]</span>minutes, in order to give Cumberland a chance of
being ready&mdash;to which Thomas replied:&mdash;
</p>
<p>
"Very well, sir, anything to oblige you, Mr. Oaklands," muttering to
himself as he went off, "wonder what that chap Cumberland is up to now;
no good, I'll be bound".
</p>
<p>
In another minute we heard his voice in the lower regions, exclaiming:&mdash;
</p>
<p>
"I say, cook, mustn't dish up for the next ten minutes; master ain't
quite finished his next Sunday's sermon; he's got hitched just at
thirdly and lastly, and mustn't be disturbed; not on no account";&mdash;which
produced from that functionary the following pathetic rejoinder:&mdash;
</p>
<p>
"Then, it's hall hup with the pigeon pie, for it will be burnt as black
as my blessed shoe by that time!"
</p>
<p>
As I was descending the stairs, ready to go out, the next day, Oaklands
called me into his room, and, closing the door, said:&mdash;
</p>
<p>
"Well, Fairlegh, I have thought over all you said yesterday,&mdash;made up my
mind&mdash;and acted upon it".
</p>
<p>
"Bravo!" replied I, "I am so glad, for, whenever you will but rouse
yourself, you are sure to act more rightly and sensibly than anybody
else; but what have you done now? Let me hear all about it."
</p>
<p>
"Oh, nothing very wonderful," answered Oaklands; "when I came to look
at my pocket-book, I found I had lost, from first to last, above one
hundred and fifty pounds."
</p>
<p>
"Good gracious!" cried I, aghast at the magnitude of the sum; "what will
you do?"
</p>
<p>
Oaklands smiled at my look of horror, and continued:&mdash;
</p>
<p>
"About one hundred pounds of this I still owe Cumberland, for, after my
ready money was gone, I merely set down on paper all I won or lost, as
he said I could pay him at any time, just as it suited me best; and I
thought I would wait till I got my next quarter's allowance, pay him out
of that, and be very economical ever after. Well, when I saw what the
sums amounted to, I found this plan certainly would not answer, and that
I was getting into a mess; so I made up my mind to put an end to the
thing at once,&mdash;and sat down to write to my father, telling him I had
been playing billiards every day for some time past with a friend,&mdash;of
course I did not mention who,&mdash;and that, without being at all aware
of it, my losses had mounted up till I owed him one hundred pounds. I
mentioned at the same time that I had a pretty long bill at Smithson's;
and then went on to say that I saw the folly, if not worse than folly,
of what I had been doing; and that I applied <span class="pagenum">[74]</span>to him, as the best
friend I had in the world,&mdash;and I am sure he is too, Frank,&mdash;to save me
from the consequences of my own imprudence."
</p>
<p>
"I am very glad you did that; it was much the wisest thing," interrupted
I.
</p>
<p>
"As soon as I had written my letter," continued Oaklands, "I went
to Cumberland, and told him that I found I had been going on over
fast,&mdash;that I owned he was too good a player for me,&mdash;and that I
therefore did not mean to play any more&mdash;and would pay him as soon as I
received my father's answer."
</p>
<p>
"And what did he say to that?" inquired I.
</p>
<p>
"Why, he seemed surprised and a little annoyed, I fancied. He denied
being the best player, and begged I would not think of paying him yet,
saying that I had been unlucky of late, but that, if I would go on
boldly, luck was sure to change, and that I should most likely win it
all back again."
</p>
<p>
"And you?"
</p>
<p>
"Oh! I told him that was the true spirit of gambling; that I did not
choose to owe so much to any man as I owed him, and that pay him I
would. Well then, he said, that if I did not like to trouble my father
about such a trifle, and yet was determined to pay him, it could be very
easily managed. I asked how? He hummed and ha'd, and at last said that
Smithson would advance me the money in a minute&mdash;that I should only have
to sign a receipt for it, and need not pay him for years&mdash;not till I
was of age, and not then if I did not like&mdash;that no one would be any the
wiser&mdash;and he was going on with more in the same style, when I stopped
him, by answering very abruptly, that such an arrangement was not to my
taste, and that I was not yet reduced be borrowing money of my tailor."
</p>
<p>
"Quite right, I am so glad you told him that," interposed I; "what <i>did</i>
he say then?"
</p>
<p>
"Something about not intending to offend me, and its being a thing done
every day."
</p>
<p>
"By him perhaps," said I, recollecting the scene I had witnessed soon
after my arrival.
</p>
<p>
"Why! what do you mean?" said Oaklands.
</p>
<p>
"I'll tell you when you have done," replied I; "but I want to know how
all this ended."
</p>
<p>
"There was not much more. He tried to persuade me to go again to-day,
and play another match. I told him I was engaged to ride with you.
Then he looked as if he was going to be angry. I waited to see, and he
wasn't, and so we parted."
</p>
<p>
<span class="pagenum">[75]</span>"And what think you of Cumberland now?" inquired I. "I can't say
I altogether like the way in which he has behaved about this," replied
Oaklands; "it certainly looks as if he would have had no objection to
win as much as he could from me, for he must have known all along that
he was the best player. It strikes me that I am well out of the mess,
and I have to thank you for being so too, old fellow."
</p>
<p>
"Nay, you have to thank your own energy and decision; I did nothing
towards helping you out of your difficulties." "Indeed! if a man is
walking over a precipice with his eyes shut, is it nothing to cause him
to open them, in order that he may see the dangers into which the path
he is following will lead him?"
</p>
<p>
"Ah! Harry, if you would but exert yourself, so as to keep your own eyes
open&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>
<p>
"What a wide-awake fellow you would be!" interposed Coleman, who, after
having tapped twice, without succeeding in making himself heard (so
engrossed were we by the conversation in which we were engaged), had
in despair opened the door in time to overhear my last remark. "I say,
gents, as Thomas calls us," continued he, "what have you been doing to
Cumberland to put him into such a charming temper?"
</p>
<p>
"Is he out of humour then?" inquired Oaklands. "I should say, <i>rather</i>,"
replied Coleman, winking ironically; "he came into our room just now,
looking as black as thunder, and, as I know he hates to be spoken to
when he is in the sulks, I asked him if you were going to play billiards
with him to-day."
</p>
<p>
Harry and I exchanged glances, and Coleman continued:&mdash;
</p>
<p>
"He fixed his eyes upon me, and stared as if he would have felt greatly
relieved by cutting my throat, and at last growled out, 'No; that you
were going to ride with Fairlegh'; to which I replied, 'that it was
quite delightful to see what great friends you had become'; whereupon
he ground his teeth with rage, and told me 'to go to the devil for a
prating fool'; so I answered, that I was not in want of such an article
just at present, and had not time to go so far to-day, and then I came
here instead. Oh, he's in no end of a rage, I know."
</p>
<p>
"And your remarks would not tend to soothe him much either," said I.
"Oaklands has just been telling him he does not mean to play billiards
again."
</p>
<p>
"Phew!" whistled Coleman, "that was a lucky shot of mine; I fancied it
must have been something about <span class="pagenum">[76]</span>Oaklands and billiards that had gone
wrong, when I saw how savage it made him. I like to <i>rile</i> Cumberland
sometimes, because he's always so soft and silky; he seems afraid of
getting into a good honest rage, lest he should let out something he
does not want one to know. I hate such extreme caution; it always makes
me think there must be something very wrong to be concealed, when people
are so mighty particular."
</p>
<p>
"You are not quite a fool after all, Freddy," said Oaklands,
encouragingly.
</p>
<p>
"Thank ye for nothing, Harry Longlegs," replied Coleman,&mdash;skipping
beyond the reach of Oaklands' arm. A few mornings after this
conversation took place Oaklands, who was sitting in the recess of the
window (from which he had ejected Lawless on the memorable evening of
his arrival), called me to him, and asked in a low tone of voice whether
I should mind calling at the billiard-rooms when I went out, and paying
a month's subscription which he owed there. He added that he did not
like going himself, for fear of meeting Cumberland or the Captain, as if
they pressed him to play, and he refused (which he certainly should do),
something disagreeable might occur, which it was quite as well to avoid.
In this I quite agreed, and willingly undertook the commission. While we
were talking Thomas came into the room with a couple of letters, one of
which he gave to Oaklands, saying, it had just come by the post, while
he handed the other to Cumberland, informing him that the gentleman who
brought it was waiting for an answer. I fancied that Cumberland changed
colour slightly when his eye fell upon the writing. After rapidly
perusing the note, he crushed it in his hand, and flung it into the
fire, saying:&mdash;
</p>
<p>
"My compliments to the gentleman, and I'll be with him at the time he
mentions".
</p>
<p>
"Well, this <i>is</i> kind of my father," exclaimed Oaklands, looking up with
a face beaming with pleasure; "after writing me the warmest and most
affectionate letter possible, he sends me an order for three hundred
pounds upon his banker, telling me always to apply to him when I want
money, or get into difficulties of any kind; and that if I will promise
him that this shall be the case, I need never be afraid of asking for
too much, as he should be really annoyed were I to stint myself."
</p>
<p>
"What a pattern for fathers!" exclaimed Coleman, rubbing his hands. "I
only wish my old dad would test my obedience in that sort of way;&mdash;I'd
take care I would <span class="pagenum">[77]</span>not annoy him by asking for too little; he need
not fret himself on that account. Ugh!" continued he, with a look of
intense disgust, "it's quite dreadful to think what perverted ideas he
has on the subject; he actually fancies it his business to <i>spend</i> his
money as well as to make it; and as for sons, the less they have the
better, lest they should get into extravagant habits, forsooth! I
declare it's quite aggravating to think of the difference between
people: a cheque for three hundred pounds from a father, who'll be
annoyed if one does not always apply to him for money enough! Open the
window there! I am getting faint!"
</p>
<p>
"Don't you think there's a little difference between sons as well as
fathers, Master Fred, eh?" inquired Lawless. "I should say some sons
might be safely trusted with three-hundred-pound cheques; while others
are certain to waste two shillings, and misapply sixpence, out of every
half-crown they may get hold of."
</p>
<p>
"Sir, I scorn your insinuations; sir, you're no gentleman," was the
reply, producing (as was probably intended) an attack from Lawless,
which Coleman avoided for some time by dodging round chairs and under
tables. After the chase had lasted for several minutes Coleman, when on
the point of being captured, contrived, by a master-stroke of policy,
to substitute Mullins in his place, and the affair ended by that worthy
being knocked down by Lawless, "for always choosing to interfere with
everything," and being kicked up again by Coleman, "for having prevented
him from properly vindicating his wounded honour".
</p>
<p>
"Who's going near the Post-office, and will put a letter in for me?"
asked Oaklands.
</p>
<p>
"I am," replied Cumberland; "I've got one of my own to put in also."
</p>
<p>
"Don't forget it or lose it, for it's rather important," added Oaklands;
"but I need not caution you, you are not one of the harebrained sort; if
it had been my friend Freddy, now&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>
<p>
"I'll tell you what it is, Mr. Oaklands," said Coleman, putting on an
air of offended dignity, in which, though very much exaggerated, there
was at the bottom the smallest possible spice of reality&mdash;a thing,
by the way, one may often observe in people who have a very strong
appreciation of the ridiculous, and who, however fond they may be of
doing absurd things for the sake of being laughed at, do not approve of
their buffooneries being taken for granted&mdash;"I'll tell you what it is,
sir&mdash;you have <span class="pagenum">[78]</span>formed a most mistaken estimate of my character; I
beg to say that any affair I undertake is certain to be conducted in
a very sedate and business-like manner. My prudence I consider
unimpeachable; and as to steadiness, I flatter myself I go considerably
ahead of the Archbishop of Canterbury in that article. If I hear you
repeat such offensive remarks, I shall be under the painful necessity of
elongating your already sufficiently prolonged proboscis."
</p>
<p>
"Come and try," said Oaklands, folding his arms with an air of defiance.
Coleman, reckoning on his adversary's dislike of exertion, and
trusting to his own extreme quickness and activity to effect his escape
scot-free, made a feint of turning away as if to avoid the contest, and
then, with a sudden spring, leaped upon Oaklands, and succeeded in just
touching his nose. The latter was, however, upon his guard, and while,
by seizing his outstretched arm with one hand, he prevented him from
attaining his object, he caught him by the coat-collar with the other,
and detained him prisoner.
</p>
<p>
"I've got you this time, at all events, Master Freddy; now what shall I
do with you, to pay you off for all your impertinence?" said Oaklands,
looking round the room in search of something suitable to his purpose.
"I have it," continued he, as his eyes encountered the bookcase, which
was a large square-topped, old-fashioned affair, standing about eight
feet high, and the upper part forming a sort of glass-fronted closet,
in which the books were arranged on shelves. "Great men like you, who
go ahead of archbishops and so on, should be seated in high places."
So saying he lifted Coleman in his arms, with as much ease as if he had
been a kitten; and, stepping up on a chair which stood near, seated him
on the top of the bookcase, with his head touching the ceiling, and his
feet dangling about six feet from the ground.
</p>
<p>
"What a horrid shame!" said Coleman; "come help me down again, Harry,
there's a good fellow."
</p>
<p>
"I help you down!" rejoined Oaklands, "I've had trouble enough in
putting you up, I think; I'm a great deal too much tired to help you
down again."
</p>
<p>
"Well, if you won't, there's nobody else can," said Coleman, "unless
they get a ladder, or a fire-escape&mdash;don't call me proud, gentlemen, if
I look down upon you all, for I assure you it's quite involuntary on my
part."
</p>
<p>
"A decided case of 'up aloft': he looks quite the cherub, does he not?"
said Lawless.
</p>
<p>
<span class="pagenum">[79]</span>"They are making game of you, Coleman," cried Mullins, grinning.
</p>
<p>
"I hope not," was the reply, "for in that case I should be much too
<i>high</i> to be pleasant."
</p>
<p>
"They ought to keep you there for an hour longer for that vile pun,"
said Cumberland. "Is your letter ready, Oaklands, for I must be going?"
</p>
<p>
"It is upstairs, I'll fetch it," replied Oaklands, leaving the room.
</p>
<p>
"Well, as it seems I am here for life, I may as well make myself
comfortable," said Coleman, and, suiting the action to the word, he
crossed his legs under him like a tailor, and folding his arms leaned
his back against the wall, the picture of ease.
</p>
<p>
At this moment there was a gentle tap at the door; some one said
"Come in," and, without a word of preparation, Dr. Mildman entered the
apartment. Our surprise and consternation at this apparition may easily
be imagined. Cumberland and Lawless tried to carry it off by assuming
an easy unembarrassed air, as if nothing particular was going on; I felt
strongly disposed to laugh; while Mullins looked much more inclined to
cry; but the expression of Coleman's face, affording a regular series
of "dissolving views" of varied emotions, was the "gem" of the whole
affair. The unconscious cause of all this excitement, whose back was
turned towards the bookcase, walked quietly up to his usual seat,
saying, as he did so:&mdash;
</p>
<a name="image-0005"><!--IMG--></a>
<center>
<img src="images/page079.jpg" height="951" width="619"
alt="Page79 the Doctor Makes a Discovery 
">
</center>

<p>
"Don't let me disturb you&mdash;I only came to look for my eye-glass, which I
think I must have dropped".
</p>
<p>
"I see it, sir," said I, springing forward and picking it up; "how lucky
none of us happened to tread on it and break it!"
</p>
<p>
"Thank you, Fairlegh, it is an old friend, and I should have been sorry
to have any harm happen to it," replied he, as he turned to leave the
room, without having once raised his eyes from the ground. Coleman, who
up to this moment had considered a discovery inevitable, gave me a sign
to open the door, and, believing the danger over, was proceeding to
relieve his feelings by making a hideous face at his retiring tutor,
when the bookcase, affected no doubt by the additional weight placed
upon it, suddenly gave a loud crack.
</p>
<p>
"Bless my heart," said Dr. Mildman, looking up in alarm, "what's that?
Gracious me!" continued he, starting back as his eyes encountered
Coleman, "there's something alive up there! why it's&mdash;eh?" continued he,
levelling his newly restored eye-glass at the object of his <span class="pagenum">[80]</span>alarm;
"yes, it certainly <i>is</i> Coleman; pray, sir, is it usually your 'custom
of an afternoon,' as Shakspeare has it, to sit perched up there
cross-legged, like a Chinese mandarin? It's a very singular taste."
</p>
<p>
"Why, sir," replied Coleman, for once completely taken aback, "you see I
didn't&mdash;that is, I wasn't&mdash;I mean, if I hadn't&mdash;I shouldn't."
</p>
<p>
"Hum," resumed Dr. Mildman, with whom he was rather a favourite, and
who, now that he had satisfied himself it was not some wild animal he
had to deal with, was evidently amused by Coleman's embarrassment,
"that sentence of yours is not particularly clear or explanatory; but,"
continued he, as a new idea occurred to him, "how in the world did you
get up there? you must have flown."
</p>
<p>
"I didn't get up, I was&mdash;that is, he&mdash;&mdash;" stammered
</p>
<p>
Coleman, remembering just in time that he could not explain without
involving Oaklands.
</p>
<p>
"And how are you ever to get down again?" said Dr. Mildman.
</p>
<p>
"Has the pretty bird flown yet?" cried Oaklands, hastily entering the
room; when, observing the addition the party had received during
his absence, he started back, murmuring in an under tone, "The old
gentleman, by Jove!" Quickly recovering himself, however, he sprang upon
a chair, and, seizing Coleman in his arms, whisked him down with more
haste than ceremony; and going up to Dr. Mildman said respectfully,
"That was a bit of folly of mine, sir; I put him up there; I merely did
it for a joke, and I hadn't an idea you would come in and find him".
</p>
<p>
"Never mind," replied Dr. Mildman, good-naturedly, "as you have
contrived to get him down again safely there is no harm done;" adding as
he left the room, "that young man is as strong as Hercules. I hope he'll
never take it into his head to pop me up anywhere, for I am sure he
could do it if he chose."

          "Play not for gain but sport; who plays for more
          Than he can lose with pleasure, stakes his heart."
          &mdash;Herbert.

          "If you are so bold as to venture a blowing-up, look closely
          to it! for the plot lies deadly deep... but of all things have
          a care of putting it in your pocket,... and if you can shun
          it, read it not;... consider well what you do, and look
          to yourself,... for there is danger and jeopardy in it."&mdash;
          &mdash;Dr. Eachard.
</pre>
<p>
IN the course of my walk that afternoon I called at the billiard-rooms
in F&mdash;&mdash; Street, in order to pay Oaklands' subscription. On inquiring
for Mr. Johnson, the proprietor, I was told that he was engaged at
present, but that if I did not mind waiting for a few minutes, he would
be able to attend to me. To this I agreed, and was shown into a small
room downstairs, which, from its sanded floor, and a strong odour of
stale tobacco which pervaded it, was apparently used as a smoking-room.
It opened into what seemed to be a rather spacious apartment from which
it was divided by a glass half-door, across the lower panes of which
hung a green blind: this door, on my entrance, was standing slightly
ajar. The day being cold, there was a bright fire burning on the hearth;
near this I seated myself, and, seduced by its drowsy influence, fell
into a kind of trance, in which, between sleeping and waking, my mind
wandered away to a far different scene, among well-known forms and
familiar faces that had been strangers to me now for many a long day.
From this day-dream I was aroused by sounds, which, proceeding from the
adjoining apartment, resolved themselves, as I became more thoroughly
awake, into the voices of two persons apparently engaged in angry
colloquy.
</p>
<p>
"I tell you," said a gruff voice, which somehow seemed familiar to
me&mdash;"I tell you it is the only chance for you; you must contrive to
bring him here again, and that without loss of time."
</p>
<p>
"Must I again repeat that the thing is impossible?" was the reply, in
tones I knew but too well; "utterly impossible; when once his mind is
made up, and he takes the trouble to exert himself, he is immovable;
nothing can shake his determination."
</p>
<p>
"And is this your boasted skill and management?" <span class="pagenum">[82]</span>rejoined the first
speaker; "how comes it, pray, that this overgrown child, who seemed the
other day to be held as nicely in leading-strings as need be&mdash;this raw
boy, whose hot-headedness, simplicity, and indolence rendered him as
easy a pigeon to pluck as one could desire; how comes it, I say, that he
has taken alarm in this sudden manner, so as to refuse to come here any
more? you've bungled this matter most shamefully, sir, and must take the
consequences."
</p>
<p>
"That's just the point I cannot make out," replied the second speaker,
who, as the reader has probably discovered, was none other than
Cumberland; "it's easy enough for you to lay it all to my mismanagement,
Captain Spicer, but I tell you it is no such thing; did I not
accommodate my play to his, always appearing to win by some accident, so
that the fool actually believed himself the better player, while he was
losing from twenty to thirty pounds a day? Didn't I excite him, and lead
him on by a mixture of flattery and defiance, so that he often fancied
he was persuading me to play against my will, and was so ready to bet
that I might have won three times what I have of him, if you had not
advised me to go on quietly, and by degrees? Did not you refuse when I
wished you to take him in hand yourself, because you said I understood
him best, and managed him admirably? No, I believe that detestable young
Fairlegh is at the bottom of it: I observed him watching me with that
calm, steadfast glance of his, that I hated him for from the first
moment I saw him; I felt certain some mischief would arise from it."
</p>
<p>
"Yes!" replied Spicer, "that was your fault too: why did you let the
other bring him; every fool knows that lookers-on see most of the game."
</p>
<p>
"I was afraid to say much against it, lest Oaklands should suspect
anything," rejoined Cumberland; "but I wish to Heaven I had now; I might
have been sure no good would come from it&mdash;that boy is my evil genius."
</p>
<p>
"I have no time for talking about geniuses, and such confounded stuff,"
observed Spicer, angrily, "so now to business, Mr. Cumberland: you are
aware you owe me two hundred pounds, I presume?"
</p>
<p>
Cumberland grumbled out an unwilling assent, to which he appended a
muttered remark not exactly calculated to enhance the Captain's future
comfort.
</p>
<p>
"Like a good-natured fool," continued Spicer, "I agreed to wait for my
money till you had done what you could with this Oaklands."
</p>
<p>
"For which forbearance you were to receive fifty <span class="pagenum">[83]</span>pounds extra,
besides anything you could make out of him by private bets," put in
Cumberland.
</p>
<p>
"Of course I was not going to wait all that time for my money for
nothing," was the reply; "you have only as yet paid me fifty pounds, you
tell me you can't persuade Oaklands to play again, so there's nothing
more to be got from that quarter, consequently nothing more to wait for.
I must trouble you, therefore, to pay me the two hundred pounds at
once; for, to be plain with you, it won't do for me to remain here any
longer&mdash;the air does not agree with my constitution."
</p>
<p>
"And where on earth am I to get two hundred pounds at a minute's
notice?" said Cumberland; "you are as well aware the thing is impossible
as I am."
</p>
<p>
"I am aware of this, sir," replied the Captain with an oath, "that I'll
have my money; ay, and this very day too, or I'll expose you&mdash;curse me
if I don't. I know your uncle's address: yes! you may well turn pale,
and gnaw your lip&mdash;other people can plot and scheme as well as
yourself: if I'm not paid before I leave this place, and that will be
by to-night's mail, your uncle shall be told that his nephew is an
insolvent gambler; and the old tutor, the Rev. Dr. Mildman, shall have a
hint that his head pupil is little better than a blackleg."
</p>
<p>
"Now listen to me, Spicer," said Cumberland quietly; "I know you might
do what you have threatened, and that to me it would be neither more nor
less than ruin, but&mdash;and this is the real question&mdash;pray what possible
advantage (save calling people's attention to the share, a pretty large
one, you have had in making me what I am) would it be to you?"
</p>
<p>
"To me, sir? eh! why, what do you mean, sir? your uncle is a man of
honour, and, of course, as such would pay his nephew's debts for him,
more particularly when he knows that if he refuses to do so that nephew
will be sent to jail; yes, to jail, sir."
</p>
<p>
"There; blustering is of no use with me, so you may save yourself that
trouble, Captain," replied Cumberland; "as to sending me to jail, that
is absurd; you can't arrest a minor for debt, and I shall not be of
age these two years. My uncle is, as you say, what is called a man of
honour, but he is not one of those over-scrupulous fools who will pay
any demand, however dishonest and unreasonable, rather than tarnish the
family honour, forsooth! No! he will pay what the law compels him, and
not a farthing more I leave you to decide whether the law is likely
to be of much use to you in the present <span class="pagenum">[84]</span>case. Now, listen to me;
though you cannot obtain the money by the means you proposed, you can,
as I said before, do me serious injury; therefore, if for no other
reason but to stop your mouth, I would pay you the whole if I could,
but I have not the power of doing so at present. What I propose then is
this&mdash;Oaklands will pay me, in a day or two, one hundred pounds; this
I will hand over to you at once, and will give you a written promise to
pay you the rest in the course of the next six months; for before that
time I must raise money somehow, even if I have to sell every farthing I
expect to come into to the Jews, in order to do it."
</p>
<p>
"Won't do," was the reply; "the ready isn't enough; I must leave this
country in a day or two, and I must have money to take with me; come,
one hundred and fifty pounds down, and I'll let you off the other
fifty."
</p>
<p>
"It's impossible, I can get no other money yet, excepting the sum
Oaklands is to pay me."
</p>
<p>
"Yes! and how the devil am I to be sure he will pay you directly; I'm
pretty certain the fool's hard up himself; he hasn't paid cash for a
month past."
</p>
<p>
"If that's all you're afraid of, I can soon convince you to the
contrary; here's a letter to his father's banker, which I am going to
put into the post directly, with a cheque for three hundred pounds
in it; there, hold it up to the light, and you can see the figures
yourself."
</p>
<p>
"By Jove! so it is," exclaimed Spicer: "I say, Cumberland," he
continued, and then the voices almost sunk into a whisper, so that
I could not catch more than a word here and there, but by the tone I
judged that the Captain was making some proposition, to which Cumberland
refused to agree.
</p>
<p>
At length I heard the former say, "Fifty pounds down, and a receipt in
full ".
</p>
<p>
Cumberland's reply was inaudible, but when the Captain spoke again I
caught the following words: "Not the slightest risk, only you do as I
say, and&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>
<p>
At this moment the outer door of the room in which I was sitting opened,
while the one communicating with the other apartment was violently
slammed to from the farther side, and I heard no more.
</p>
<p>
The newcomer was a little slipshod girl in dirty curlpapers, who
informed me that her master was sorry he could not see me that day as
he was particularly engaged, but if I would do him the favour of calling
to-morrow, at the same hour, he should be at leisure, etc. To this I
answered something, I scarcely knew what, and, seizing <span class="pagenum">[85]</span>my
hat, rushed out at the front door, to the great astonishment of the
curl-papered damsel, who cast an anxious glance at the pegs in the hall,
ere she could convince herself that I had not departed with more hats
and coats than legitimately belonged to me.
</p>
<p>
It was not until I had proceeded the length of two or three streets,
that I could collect my ideas sufficiently to form anything like a
just estimate of the extraordinary disclosures with which I had so
unexpectedly become acquainted, and no sooner had I in some measure
succeeded in so doing, than the puzzling question presented itself to
me, what line of conduct it would be advisable to adopt, in consequence
of what I had heard. I asked myself too, to begin with, what right I
had to make any use of a private conversation, which accident alone had
caused me to overhear? Would not people say I had behaved dishonourably
in having listened to it at all? But then again, by preserving
Cumberland's secret, and concealing his real character from Oaklands,
should not I, as it were, become a party to any nefarious schemes he
might contemplate for the future? Having failed in one instance in his
attempt on Oaklands' purse, would he not (having, as I was now fully
aware, such a strong necessity for money) devise some fresh plan, which
might succeed in its object, were Oaklands still ignorant of the real
character of the person he had to deal with? And in such case should
not I be answerable for any mischief which might ensue? Nay, for aught
I knew, some fresh villainy might be afloat even now; what plan could
Spicer have been urging, which Cumberland seemed unwilling to adopt, if
not something of this nature, and which might be prevented were Oaklands
made aware of all the circumstances?
</p>
<p>
This last idea settled the business. I determined to reveal everything
to Oaklands in confidence, and to be guided in my subsequent conduct by
his opinion. Having once arrived at this conclusion, the next thing
was to carry my intentions into effect with as little loss of time as
possible. I consequently started off at speed in a homeward direction,
and succeeded in reaching my destination in rather less than ten
minutes, having, at various times in the course of my route, run against
and knocked over no less than six little children, to the manifest
discomposure and indignation of as many nursery-maids, who evidently
regarded me as a commissioned agent of some modern Herod, performing my
master's work zealously.
</p>
<p>
<span class="pagenum">[86]</span>On arriving at home my impatience was doomed to be disappointed,
for Oaklands, who had gone out soon after I did, was not yet returned.
This delay, in the feverish state of anxiety and excitement in which
I was, appeared to me intolerable; and, unable to sit still, I kept
striding up and down the room, clenching my fists, and uttering
exclamations of impatience and vexation; which unusual conduct on my
part so astonished and alarmed the worthy Thomas that, after remaining
in the room till he had exhausted every conceivable pretext for so
doing, he boldly inquired whether "I did not feel myself ill, no how?"
adding his hope, that "I had not been a-exhaling laughing gas, or
any sich rumbustical wegitable?" after which he favoured me with an
anecdote of "a young man as he know'd, as had done so, wot conducted
hisself more like a hideotic fool than a sanatory Christian, ever
after". Perceiving at length that his attentions were rapidly
reducing me to the same state of mind as that of his friend, he very
considerately left me.
</p>
<p>
After half an hour of anxious expectation, in the course of which I must
have walked at least a mile or two over Dr. Mildman's parlour carpet,
Oaklands and Lawless returned together. I instantly called the former
aside, and told him I wished to speak to him alone, as I had something
of importance to communicate. To this he replied that it was very near
dinner-time; but that, if I would come up to his room, I could talk
to him while he dressed. As soon as we were safely closeted together I
began my relation, but scarcely had I got beyond "You asked me to go to
the billiard-rooms, you know "&mdash;when a hasty footstep was heard upon the
stairs; some one knocked at the door, and immediately a voice, which I
knew to be that of Cumberland, asked to be let in, "as he had something
particular to say".
</p>
<p>
"The plot thickens," said Oaklands, as, without rising from his seat, he
stretched out an immense length of arm, and opened the door.
</p>
<p>
"Hear what I have to say first," cried I; but it was too late, and
Cumberland entered, breathless, and with his usually sallow complexion
flushed with exercise and excitement.
</p>
<p>
"The most unfortunate thing"&mdash;he began; and stopping to draw breath, he
added, "I have run all the way from the post-office, as hard as my
legs would carry me&mdash;but I was going to tell you&mdash;as I went down, I met
Curtis of the &mdash;th, who told me their band was going to play in Park
Square, and asked me to go with him to hear it; and I'm <span class="pagenum">[87]</span>afraid
that, as I stood in the crowd, my pocket must have been picked, for when
I got to the post-office I found that my letter, my pocket handkerchief,
and I am sorry to say your letter also, had disappeared&mdash;so, remembering
you had told me your letter was of importance, I thought the best thing
I could do was to come home as fast as I could, and tell you."
</p>
<p>
"By Jove," exclaimed Oaklands, "that's rather a bore though; there was
my father's cheque for three hundred pounds in it; I suppose something
ought to be done about it directly."
</p>
<p>
"Write a note to stop the payment; and&mdash;let me see&mdash;as it is too late
for the post now, if you will make a parcel of it, I'll run down and
give it to the guard of the mail, begging him to deliver it himself as
soon as he gets to town&mdash;the cheque can't be presented till to-morrow
morning, so that will be all right."
</p>
<p>
"What a head you have for business, to be sure!" said Oaklands; "but why
should you have the trouble of taking it? I dare say Thomas will go with
it when we have done dinner, or I can take it myself."
</p>
<p>
"Nay," replied Cumberland, "as I have contrived to lose your letter, the
least I can do is to take the parcel; besides, I should like to speak to
the guard myself, so as to be sure there's no mistake."
</p>
<p>
While this was going on it may be imagined that my thoughts were not
idle. When Cumberland mentioned the loss of the letter my suspicions
that some nefarious scheme might be on foot began for the first time
to resolve themselves into a tangible form, but when I perceived his
anxiety to have the parcel entrusted to him, which was to prevent the
payment of the cheque, the whole scheme, or something nearly approaching
to it, flashed across me at once, and, without reflecting for a moment
on what might be the consequences of doing so, I said:&mdash;
</p>
<p>
"If Oaklands will take my advice, he will not entrust you with anything
else, till you can prove that you have really lost the letter, as you
say you have done".
</p>
<p>
Had a thunderbolt fallen in the midst of us, it could scarcely have
produced greater confusion than did this speech of mine. Oaklands sprang
upon his feet, regarding me with the greatest surprise as he asked "if
I knew what I was saying?" while Cumberland, in a voice hoarse from
passion, inquired, "What the devil I meant by my insolence? what did I
dare to insinuate he had done with the letter, if he had not lost it?"
</p>
<p>
<span class="pagenum">[88]</span>"I insinuate nothing," was my reply; "but I tell you plainly that I
believe, and have good reason for believing, that you have not lost the
letter, but given it to your gambling friend and accomplice, Captain
Spicer, who, in return for it, is to give you a receipt in full for the
two hundred pounds you owe him, and fifty pounds down." On hearing this
Cumberland turned as pale as ashes, and leaned on the back of a chair
for support, while I continued, "You look surprised, Oaklands, as well
you may; but when you hear what I have to tell, you will see that I do
not make this accusation without having good grounds to go upon ".
</p>
<p>
"I shall not stay here," said Cumberland, making an effort to recover
himself, and turning towards the door, "I shall not remain here to be
any further insulted; I wish you good-evening, Mr. Oaklands."
</p>
<p>
"Not so fast," said Oaklands, springing to the door, and locking it; "if
all this be true, and Fairlegh would not have said so much unless he
had strong facts to produce, you and I shall have an account to settle
together, Mr. Cumberland; you will not leave this room till I know the
rights of the affair. Now, Frank, let us hear how you learned all this."
</p>
<p>
"Strangely enough," replied I; and I then gave him an exact account of
all that had passed at the billiard-rooms, repeating the conversation,
word for word, as nearly as I could remember it, leaving Oaklands
to draw his own inferences therefrom. During the whole of my recital
Cumberland sat with his elbows resting on the table, and his face buried
in his hands, without offering the slightest interruption, scarcely
indeed appearing aware of what was going on, save once, when I mentioned
the fact of the door between the two rooms being slightly open, when
he muttered something about "what cursed folly!" When I had finished my
account Oaklands turned towards Cumberland, and asked in a stern
voice "what he had to say to this statement?" Receiving no answer, he
continued: But it is useless, sir, to ask you: the truth of what
Fairlegh has said is self-evident&mdash;the next question is, What is to be
done about it?" He paused for a moment as if in thought, and then
resumed: "In the position in which I now stand, forming one of Dr.
Mildman's household, and placed by my father under his control, I
scarcely consider myself a free agent. It seems to me, therefore, that
my course is clear; it is evidently my duty to inform him of the whole
affair, and afterwards to act as he may advise, Do you agree with me,
Frank?"
</p>
<p>
<span class="pagenum">[89]</span>"It is exactly what I should have proposed, had you not mentioned
it first," was my answer.
</p>
<p>
"For God's sake, Oaklands, don't," exclaimed Cumberland, raising himself
suddenly; "he will write to my uncle&mdash;I shall be expelled&mdash;my character
lost&mdash;it will be utter ruin;&mdash;have pity upon me&mdash;I will get you back
your money, I will indeed, only don't tell Mildman."
</p>
<p>
"I have treated you up to the present time as a gentleman and a friend,"
replied Oaklands; "you have proved yourself unworthy of either title,
and deserve nothing at my hands but the strictest justice; no one could
blame me were I to allow the law to take its course with you, as with
any other swindler, but this I shall be most unwilling to do; nothing
short of Dr. Mildman's declaring it to be my positive duty will prevail
upon me. But our tutor ought to be informed of it, and shall: he is a
good, kind-hearted man, and if his judgment should err at all, you may
feel sure it will be on the side of mercy. Fairlegh, will you go down
and ask Dr. Mildman if I can speak to him on a matter of importance,
now, at once? you will find him in his study. Let me know when he is
ready, and we will come down; for," added he, turning to Cumberland,
"I do not lose sight of you till this business is settled one way or
other."
</p>
<p>
When I had told my errand Dr. Mildman, who looked a good deal surprised
and a little frightened, desired me (on receiving my assurance that the
business would not do as well after dinner) to tell Oaklands to come to
him immediately. To this Oaklands replied by desiring me to hold myself
in readiness for a summons, as he should want me presently. Then,
linking his arm within that of Cumberland, he half-led, half-forced, him
out of the room. In another minute I heard the study-door close behind
them.
</p>
<p>
"Now, Fairlegh," said Dr. Mildman, when, in about a quarter of an hour's
time, I had been sent for, "I wish you to repeat to me the conversation
you overheard at the billiard-room, as nearly word for word as you can
remember it."
</p>
<p>
This I hastened to do; the Doctor listening with the most profound
attention, and asking one or two questions on any point which did not
at first appear quite clear to him. When I had concluded he resumed his
inquiries by asking whether I had seen the parties who were speaking. To
this I answered in the negative.
</p>
<p>
"But you imagined you recognised the voices?"
</p>
<p>
"Yes, sir."
</p>
<p>
"Whose did you take them to be?"
</p>
<p>
<span class="pagenum">[90]</span>"One I believed to be Cumberland's, the other that of a Captain
Spicer, whom I had seen when I was there before."
</p>
<p>
"How often have you been there?"
</p>
<p>
"Twice, sir; once about a week ago, and again to-day."
</p>
<p>
"And have you the slightest moral doubt as to the fact of the persons
you heard speaking being Cumberland and this Captain Spicer?"
</p>
<p>
"Not the slightest; I feel quite certain of it."
</p>
<p>
"That is all clear and straightforward enough," observed Dr. Mildman,
turning to the culprit. "I am afraid the case is only too fully proved
against you; have you anything to say which can at all establish your
innocence?"
</p>
<p>
"It would be of no use if I were to do so," said Cumberland, in a sullen
manner; "it is all a matter of assertion; you choose to believe what
they say, and if I were to deny it, you would not believe me without
proof, and how can I prove a negative?"
</p>
<p>
"But do you deny it?" inquired Dr. Mildman, regarding him with a clear,
scrutinising look. Cumberland attempted to speak, but, meeting Dr.
Mildman's eye, was unable to get out a word, and turned away, concealing
his face in his handkerchief.
</p>
<p>
"This is a sad piece of business," said Dr. Mildman; "I suppose you mean
to prosecute, Oaklands?"
</p>
<p>
"I shall be most unwilling to do so," was the reply; "nor will I, sir,
unless you consider it my positive duty; I would rather lose the money
ten times over than bring such a disgrace upon Cumberland."
</p>
<p>
"You are a kind-hearted fellow," replied the Doctor; "it really is a
very difficult case in which to know how to act. As a general principle,
I am most averse to anything like hushing up evil."
</p>
<a name="image-0006"><!--IMG--></a>

">
</center>

<p>
"For Heaven's sake have pity upon me, Dr. Mildman," cried Cumberland,
throwing himself on his knees before him; "I confess it all. I did allow
Spicer to keep the cheque; he threatened to expose me, and I did it to
escape detection; but promise you will not prosecute me, and I will tell
you where he may be found, so that something may be done about it yet. I
will pay anything you please. I shall come into money when I am of age,
and I can make some arrangement. I don't care what I sacrifice, if
I have to dig to earn my bread, only do not disgrace me publicly.
Remember, I am very young, and oh! if you knew what it is to be tempted
as I have been! Oaklands, Fairlegh, intercede for me; think how you
<span class="pagenum">[91]</span>should feel, either of you, if you were placed in my situation!"
</p>
<p>
"Get up, Mr. Cumberland," observed Dr. Mildman, in a grave, impressive
manner; "it is equally needless and unbecoming to kneel to man for
forgiveness&mdash;learn to consider that position as a thing set apart and
sacred to the service of One greater than the sons of men&mdash;One, whom you
have indeed grievously offended, and to whom, in the solitude of your
chamber, you will do well to kneel, and pray that He who died to save
sinners may, in the fulness of His mercy, pardon you also." He paused,
and then resumed: "We must decide what steps had better be taken to
recover your cheque, Oaklands; it is true we can send and stop the
payment of it&mdash;but if you determine not to prosecute, for Cumberland's
sake, you must let off this man Spicer also, in which case it would be
advisable to prevent his presenting the cheque at all, as that might
lead to inquiries which it would be difficult to evade. You said just
now you knew where this bad man was to be found, Mr. Cumberland."
</p>
<p>
"Yes, sir, if he is not at the billiard-rooms in F&mdash;&mdash; Street, his
lodgings are at No. 14, Richmond Buildings," said Cumberland.
</p>
<p>
"Ay, exactly," replied Dr. Mildman; and, resting his head upon his
hand, he remained for some minutes buried in thought. Having at
length apparently made up his mind, he turned to Cumberland, and said:
"Considering all the circumstances of the case, Mr. Cumberland, although
I most strongly reprobate your conduct, which has grieved and surprised
me more than I can express, I am unwilling to urge Oaklands to put the
law in force against you, for more reasons than one. In the first place,
I wish to spare your uncle the pain which such an exposure must occasion
him; and secondly, I cannot but hope that at your age, so severe a
lesson as this may work a permanent change in you, and that at some
future period you may regain that standing among honourable men, which
you have now so justly forfeited, and I am anxious that this should not
be prevented by the stigma which a public examination must attach to
your name for ever. I will therefore at once go with you to the abode
of this man Spicer, calling on my way at the house of a legal friend of
mine, whom I shall try to get to accompany us. I presume we shall have
no great difficulty in procuring restitution of the stolen letter, when
the culprit perceives that his schemes are found out, and that it
is consequently valueless to him. Having succeeded in this, we shall
<span class="pagenum">[92]</span>endeavour to come to some equitable arrangement in regard to his
claims on you&mdash;do you agree to this?" Cumberland bowed his head in token
of assent, and Dr. Mildman continued:&mdash;
</p>
<p>
"And you, Oaklands, do you approve of this plan?" "It is like yourself,
Doctor, the perfection of justice and kindness," replied Oaklands,
warmly.
</p>
<p>
"That is well," resumed Dr. Mildman; "I have one more painful duty
to perform, which may as well be done at once&mdash;you are aware, Mr.
Cumberland, that I must expel you?"
</p>
<p>
"Will you not look over my fault this once?" entreated Cumberland;
"believe me, I will never give you cause for complaint again."
</p>
<p>
"No, sir," was the reply; "in justice to your companions I cannot longer
allow you to remain under the same roof with them: it is my duty to
see that they associate only with persons fitted for the society of
gentlemen, amongst whom, I am sorry to say, I can no longer class you. I
shall myself accompany you to town to-morrow, and, if possible, see your
uncle, to inform him of this unhappy affair. And now, sir, prepare to
go with me to this Captain Spicer;&mdash;on our return you will oblige me
by remaining in your room during the evening. Oaklands, will you ask
Lawless to take my place at the dinner-table, and inform your companions
that Cumberland has been engaged in an affair, of which I so strongly
disapprove, that I have determined on expelling him, but that you are
not at liberty to disclose the particulars? I need scarcely repeat this
caution to you, Fairlegh; you have shown so much good sense and right
feeling throughout the whole business that I am certain you will respect
my wishes on this head."
</p>
<p>
I murmured some words in assent, and so ended one of the most painful
and distressing scenes it has ever been my fate to witness. <span class="pagenum">[93]</span>

<h2>
    CHAPTER X &mdash; THE BOATING PARTY
</h2>
<pre>
          "Fair laughs the morn, and soft the zephyr blows,
          While proudly riding o'er the azure realm,
          In gallant trim the gilded vessel goes,
          Youth on the prow, and pleasure at the helm."
          &mdash;Gray's Bard.

          "Shall I not take mine ease in mine inn?"
          &mdash;Henry IV.
</pre>
<p>
THE dinner passed off heavily; every attempt to keep up a continued
conversation failed entirely; and a general feeling of relief was
experienced when the time arrived for us to retire to the pupils' room.
Even here, however, the state of things was not much better. Lawless
and the others having in vain attempted to learn more of the affair from
Oaklands and myself than we felt at liberty to tell them, lounged over a
book, or dozed by the fire; whilst we, unable to converse on the subject
which alone engrossed our thoughts, and disinclined to do so upon any
other, were fain to follow their example. About half-past eight Dr.
Mildman and Cumberland returned, and, after dinner, which was served
to them in the Doctor's study, Cumberland retired to his room, where
he remained during the rest of the evening. Oaklands then received a
summons from the Doctor, and, on his return, informed us that (as we had
already heard) Cumberland was to be expelled. He added that Dr. Mildman
intended to take him to town himself the next morning, as he was anxious
to see Cumberland's uncle, who was also his guardian: he would probably,
therefore, not return till the following day, in consequence of which
we should have a whole holiday, and he trusted to us to spend it in a
proper manner, which, as Coleman remarked, proved that he was of a very
confiding disposition indeed, and no mistake.
</p>
<p>
When we went up to bed Oaklands beckoned me into his room, and, as
soon as he had closed the door, gave me an account (having obtained Dr.
Mildman's permission to do so) of the interview with Spicer. They found
him, it seemed, at his lodgings, preparing for his departure. At first
he took a very high tone, denied the whole thing, and was extremely
blustering and impertinent; but on being confronted with Cumberland, and
<span class="pagenum">[94]</span>threatened by Dr. Mildman's legal friend with the terrors of the
law, he became thoroughly crestfallen, restored the three-hundred-pound
cheque, and consented, on the payment of fifty pounds, in addition to
the fifty pounds he had already received, to give up all claims upon
Cumberland, whereupon they paid him the money down, made him sign a
paper to the above effect, and left him.
</p>
<p>
"And so, my dear Frank," said Oaklands, "there is an end of that affair,
and, if it only produces as much effect upon Cumberland as it has
produced upon me, it will read him a lesson he will not forget for many
a long day. I blame myself excessively," he continued, "for my own share
in this matter; if it had not been for my easy, careless way of going
on, this scheme would never have been thought of&mdash;nay, I might, perhaps,
have been able to rescue Cumberland from the hands of this sharper; but
in this manner we neglect the opportunities afforded us of doing good,
and&mdash;Frank," he continued, with a sudden burst of energy, "I will cure
myself of this abominable indolence." He paused for some minutes in
thought, and then added, "Well, I must not stand here raving at you any
longer; it is getting very late: goodnight, old fellow! I shall be
glad enough to tumble into bed, for I'm as tired as a dog: it really is
astonishing how easily I am knocked up."
</p>
<p>
The absurdity of this remark, following upon the resolution he had
expressed with so much energy but a minute before, struck us both at the
same instant, and occasioned a fit of laughter, which we did not check
till we recollected with what dissonance any approach to mirth must
strike the ear of the prisoner (for such he was in fact, if not in name)
in the adjoining apartment.
</p>
<p>
"Now, sir; come, Mr. Fairlegh, you'll be late for breakfast," were the
first sounds that reached my understanding on the following morning:
I say understanding, as I had heard, mixed up with my dreams, sundry
noises produced by unclosing shutters, arranging water-jugs, etc., which
appeared to my sleep-bewildered senses to have been going on for at
least half an hour. My faculties not being sufficiently aroused to
enable me to speak, Thomas continued, "You'll be late, Mr. Fairlegh";
then came an aside, "My wig, how he do sleep! I hope he ain't been
a-taking lauddelum, or morpheus, or anything of a somnambulous natur. I
wouldn't be master, always to have six boys a weighing on my mind, for
all the wealth of the Ingies.&mdash;Mr. Fairlegh, I say!"
</p>
<p>
"There, don't make such a row," replied I, jumping <span class="pagenum">[95]</span>out of bed and
making a dash at my clothes; "is it late?"
</p>
<p>
"Jest nine o'clock, sir; master and Mr. Cumberland's been gone these two
hours. Shocking affair that, sir; it always gives me quite a turn when
any of our gents is expelled: it's like being thrown out of place at a
minute's warning, as I said to cook only this morning. 'Cook,' says I,
'life's a curious thing,' there's&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>
<p>
"The breakfast bell ringing, by all that's unlucky," exclaimed I; and
downstairs I ran, with one arm in, and one out of my jacket, leaving
Thomas to conclude his speculations on the mutability of human affairs
as he best might, solus.
</p>
<p>
"How are we going to kill time to-day?" inquired Oaklands, as soon as we
had done breakfast.
</p>
<p>
"We mustn't do anything to outrage the proprieties," said Coleman;
"remember we are on <i>parole d'honneur</i>."
</p>
<p>
"On a fiddlestick," interrupted Lawless; "let's all ride over to
the Duke of York, at Bradford, shoot some pigeons, have a champagne
breakfast, and be home again in time for the old woman's feed at five
o'clock. I daresay I can pick up one or two fellows to go with us."
</p>
<p>
"No," said Oaklands, "that sort of thing won't do to-day. I quite agree
with Freddy, we ought not to do anything to annoy the Doctor upon this
occasion; come, Lawless, I'm sure you'll say so too, if you give it a
moment's thought."
</p>
<p>
"Well, he's a good old fellow in his way, I know, but what are we to be
at then? something I must do, if it's only to keep me out of mischief."
</p>
<p>
"It's a lovely day; let us hire a boat, and have a row," suggested
Coleman.
</p>
<p>
"That's not against the laws, is it?" asked Oaklands.
</p>
<p>
"Not a bit," replied Coleman; "we used to go pulling about like bricks
last summer, and Mildman rather approved of it than otherwise, and said
it was a very healthy exercise."
</p>
<p>
"Yes, that will do," said Lawless; "I feel savage this morning, and
a good pull will take it out of me as well as anything. Now, don't go
wasting time; let's get ready, and be off;" and accordingly in less than
half an hour we were prepared, and on our way to the beach.
</p>
<p>
"How are we going to do it?" inquired Lawless; "you'll take an oar,
Oaklands?"
</p>
<p>
Oaklands replied in the affirmative.
</p>
<p>
"Can you row, Fairlegh?"
</p>
<p>
I answered that I could a little.
</p>
<p>
<span class="pagenum">[96]</span>"That will do famously, then," said Lawless; "we'll have a
four-oar; Wilson has a capital little boat that will be just the thing;
Freddy can steer, he's a very fair hand at it, and we four fellows will
pull, so that we need not be bothered with a boatman. I do abominate
those chaps, they are such a set of humbugs."
</p>
<p>
No objection was made to this plan. Lawless succeeded in getting the
boat he wished for; it was launched without any misadventure, and we
took our places, and began pulling away merrily, with the wind (what
little there was) and tide both in our favour.
</p>
<p>
The morning was beautiful: it was one of those enjoyable days, which
sometimes occur in early spring, in which Nature, seeming to overleap
at a bound the barrier between winter and summer, gives us a delightful
foretaste of the good things she has in store for us. The clear bright
sea, its surface just ruffled by a slight breeze from the south-west,
sparkled in the sunshine, and fell in diamond showers from our oars as
we raised them out of the water, while the calm serenity of the deep
blue sky above us appeared, indeed, a fitting emblem of that heaven, in
which "the wicked cease from troubling, and the wear are at rest".
</p>
<p>
The peaceful beauty of the scene seemed to impress even the restless
spirits of which our little party was composed, and, by common consent,
we ceased rowing, and suffered the boat to drift with the tide, merely
pulling a stroke now and then to keep her head in the right direction.
After drifting for some twenty minutes or so in the manner I have
described Lawless, who never could remain quiet long, dropped the
blade of his oar into the water with a splash that made us all start,
exclaiming as he did so:&mdash;
</p>
<p>
"Well, this may be very sentimental and romantic, and all that sort of
thing, but it doesn't strike me as particularly entertaining. Why, you
fellows were all asleep, I believe."
</p>
<p>
"Heigho!" exclaimed Oaklands, rousing himself, with a deep sigh, "I was
in such a delicious reverie; what a barbarian you are, Lawless! you seem
utterly ignorant of the pleasures of the <i>dolce-far-niente</i>."
</p>
<p>
"<i>Dolce-far-devilskin</i>!" was the reply, in tones of the greatest
contempt. "I would not be as lazy as you are, Oaklands, for any money.
You are fitter to lounge about in some old woman's drawing-room, than to
handle an oar." "Well, I don't know," answered Oaklands, quietly, "but I
think I can pull as long as you can."
</p>
<p>
<span class="pagenum">[97]</span>"You do, do you?" rejoined Lawless, "it will be odd to me, if you
can. I don't think I was stroke-oar in the crack boat at Eton for a
year, without knowing how to row a little; what do you say to having a
try at once?"
</p>
<p>
"With all my heart," replied Oaklands, divesting himself of his
waistcoat, braces, and neckcloth&mdash;which latter article he braced tightly
round his waist&mdash;an example speedily followed by Lawless, who exclaimed,
as he completed his preparations:&mdash;
</p>
<p>
"Now, you young shavers, pull in your oars, and we'll give you a ride,
all free, gratis, for nothing".
</p>
<p>
Mullins and I hastened to comply with Lawless's directions, by placing
the oars and seating ourselves so as not to interfere with the trim of
the boat; while he and Oaklands, each taking a firm grasp of his oar,
commenced pulling away in real earnest. They were more evenly matched
than may be at first imagined, for Lawless, though much shorter than
Oaklands, was very square-built and broad about the shoulders, and his
arms, which were unusually long in proportion to his height, presented a
remarkable development of muscle, while it was evident, from the manner
in which he handled his oar, that he was the more practised rower of the
two. The boat, urged by their powerful strokes, appeared to fly through
the water, while cliff and headland (we were rowing along shore about
half a mile from the beach) came in view and disappeared again like
scenes in some moving panorama. We must now have proceeded some miles,
yet still the rival champions continued their exertions with unabated
energy and a degree of strength that seemed inexhaustible. Greatly
interested in the event, I had at first watched the contending parties
with anxious attention, but, perceiving that the efforts they were
making did not produce any visible effects upon them, and that the
struggle was likely to be a protracted one, I took advantage of the
opportunity to open a letter from my sister, which I had received just
as I was leaving the house. I was sorry to find, on perusing it, that my
father had been suffering from an inflammatory attack, brought on by
a cold which he had caught in returning from a visit to a sick
parishioner, through a pouring rain. A postscript from my mother,
however, added that I need not make myself in the least uneasy, as the
apothecary assured her that my father was going on as well as possible,
and would probably be quite restored in the course of a week or so. On
observing the date of the letter I found I ought to have received it the
day before. Arguing from this (on the "no-news-being-good-news" system)
<span class="pagenum">[98]</span>that I should have heard again if anything had gone wrong, I
dismissed the subject from my mind, and was reading Fanny's account of
a juvenile party she had been at in the neighbourhood, when my attention
was roused by Coleman, who, laying his hand on my shoulder, said:
</p>
<p>
"Look out, Frank, it won't be long now before we shall see who's best
man; the work's beginning to tell".
</p>
<p>
Thus invoked, I raised my eyes, and perceived that a change had come
over the aspect of affairs while I had been engaged with my letter.
Oaklands and Lawless were still rowing with the greatest energy, but it
appeared to me that their strokes were drawn with less and less vigour
each succeeding time, while their flushed faces, and heavy breathing,
proved that the severe labour they had undergone had not been without
its effect. The only visible difference between them was, that Lawless,
from his superior training, had not, as a jocky would say, "turned
a hair," while the perspiration hung in big drops upon the brow of
Oaklands, and the knotted, swollen veins of his hands stood out like
tightly strained cordage.
</p>
<p>
"Hold hard!" shouted Lawless. "I say, Harry," he continued, as soon as
they left off rowing, "how are you getting on?"
</p>
<p>
"I have been cooler in my life," replied Oaklands, wiping his face with
his handkerchief.
</p>
<p>
"Well, I think it's about a drawn battle," said Lawless; "though I am
free to confess, that if you were in proper training, I should be no
match for you, even with the oar."
</p>
<p>
"What made you stop just then?" inquired Oaklands; "I'm sure I could
have kept on for a quarter of an hour longer, if not more."
</p>
<p>
"So could I," replied Lawless, "ay, or for half an hour, if I had been
put to it; but I felt the work was beginning to tell, I saw you were
getting used up, and I recollected that we should have to row back with
the wind against us, which, as the breeze is freshening, will be no such
easy matter; so I thought if we went on till we were both done up we
should be in a regular fix."
</p>
<p>
"It's lucky you remembered it," said Oaklands; "I was so excited, I
should have gone on pulling as long as I could have held an oar; we
must be some distance from Helmstone by this time. Have you any idea
whereabouts we are?"
</p>
<p>
"Let's have a look," rejoined Lawless. "Yes, that tall cliff you see
there is the Nag's Head, and in the little bay <span class="pagenum">[99]</span>beyond stands the
village of Fisherton. I vote we go ashore there, have some bread and
cheese, and a draught of porter at the inn, and then we shall be able to
pull back again twice as well."
</p>
<p>
This proposal seemed to afford general satisfaction; Mullins and
I resumed our oars, and, in less than half an hour, we were safely
ensconced in the sanded parlour of the Dolphin, while the pretty
bar-maid, upon whom also devolved the duties of waitress, hastened to
place before us a smoking dish of eggs and bacon, which we had chosen
in preference to red herrings&mdash;the only other dainty the Dolphin had
to offer us&mdash;Coleman observing that a "hard roe" was the only part of a
herring worth eating, and we had had that already, as we came along.
</p>
<p>
"I say, my dear, have you got any bottled porter?" inquired Lawless.
</p>
<p>
"Yes, sir, and very good it is," replied the smiling damsel.
</p>
<p>
"That's a blessing," observed Coleman, piously.
</p>
<p>
"Bring us up a lot of it, my beauty," resumed Lawless, "and some pewter
pots&mdash;porter's twice as good out of its own native pewter."
</p>
<p>
Thus exhorted, the blooming waitress tripped off, and soon returned with
a basket containing six bottles of porter.
</p>
<p>
"That's the time of day," said Lawless; "now for a corkscrew, pretty
one; here you are, Oaklands."
</p>
<p>
"I must own that is capital, after such hard work as we have been
doing," observed Oaklands, as he emptied the pewter pot at a draught.
</p>
<p>
"I say, Mary," asked Coleman, "what's gone of that young man that used
to keep company along with you&mdash;that nice young chap, that had such
insinivatin ways with him?"
</p>
<p>
"I'm sure I don't know what you're talking about, sir; I've nothink to
say to no young man whatsumever," replied the damsel addressed, shaking
her curls coquettishly.
</p>
<p>
"Ah!" sighed Coleman, "if I were but single now."
</p>
<p>
"Why, you never mean to say you've got a wife already, such a very young
gentleman as you are?"
</p>
<p>
"Not only that, but a small family with a large appetite," continued
Coleman, pathetically.
</p>
<p>
"Well, I never," exclaimed the bar-maid, surprised, for once, out of
her company manners; then, observing a smile, at her expense, going the
round of the party, she added, "I see how it is; you are making fun
of me, sir; <span class="pagenum">[100]</span>oh, fie, you're a wicked young gentleman, I know you
are."
</p>
<p>
"Never mind him, my dear," said Lawless, "but give me another bottle of
porter."
</p>
<p>
In converse such as this the meal and the half-dozen of porter were
finished; in addition to which Lawless chose to have a glass of
brandy-and-water and a cigar. Having been rendered unusually hungry by
the sea air and the unaccustomed exercise of rowing, I had both eaten
and drunk more than I was in the habit of doing, to which cause may be
attributed my falling into a doze; an example which, I have every reason
to believe, was followed by most of the others. I know not how long my
nap had lasted, when I was aroused by hearing Coleman exclaim:&mdash;
</p>
<p>
"Why I think it rains! Lawless, wake up! I don't much like the look of
the weather."
</p>
<p>
"What's the row?" inquired Lawless, leisurely removing his legs from the
table on which they had been resting, and walking to the window&mdash;a feat,
by the way, he did not perform quite as steadily as usual. "By Jove!"
he continued, "the wind's blowing great guns; we must look sharp, and be
off&mdash;we shall have the sea getting up."
</p>
<p>
Accordingly, the bill was rung for and paid; Mary received half a
crown and a kiss from Lawless, and down we ran to the beach, where
difficulties we were little prepared for awaited us.

<h2>
    CHAPTER XI &mdash; BREAKERS AHEAD!
</h2>
<pre>
          "Now would I give a thousand furlongs of sea for an acre of
          barren  ground.... The wills above be done! but I would
          fain die a dry death."

          "I have great comfort from this fellow: methinks he hath
          no drowning mark upon him."&mdash;Tempest.
</pre>
<p>
THE wind, which we had observed was rising when we landed, had increased
during our stay at the inn, and was now blowing almost a gale from the
south-west; whilst the sea, which we had left smooth as a lake, was
rolling in and breaking on the beach in somewhat formidable waves.
</p>
<p>
"I tell you what," said Coleman, as soon as he had observed the state
of affairs, "I won't attempt to steer in such a sea as that; it requires
great skill and judgment, besides a stronger hand than mine, to keep the
<span class="pagenum">[101]</span>boat's head right; if I were to let her turn her broadside to one
of those waves, it would be a case of 'Found drowned' with some of us,
before long."
</p>
<p>
"What's to be done, then?" inquired Oaklands. "I am sure I can't do it:
it's a thing I'm quite ignorant of; all my boating having been on the
river."
</p>
<p>
"Let's hire one of those amphibious beggars out there to steer for us,"
proposed Lawless, pointing to a group of fishermen who were lounging
round an old boat, not far from where we stood; "they're up to all the
right dodges, you may depend. Here, my men! which of you will earn half
a guinea by steering our boat for us to Helmstone?"
</p>
<p>
"I wouldn't, master, for ten times the money," replied an old
weather-beaten boatman, in a tarpaulin hat; "and if you'll take an
old man's advice, gentlemen, you'll none of you venture out in that
cockle-shell this afternoon; the wind's getting up every minute, and we
shall have a rough night of it."
</p>
<p>
"Nonsense," replied Lawless; "I've often been out in worse weather than
this. Are you, all of you, frightened by that old woman's croaking?"
continued he, turning to the group of men.
</p>
<p>
"He's no old woman," replied a sturdy fellow, in a rough pea-jacket;
"he's been a better sailor than ever you'll be, and he's right now too,"
he added. "It's as much as a man's life is worth to go to sea in that
bit of a thing, with the waves running in as they do now&mdash;and with such
a set of landlubbers as them for a crew," he muttered, turning away.
</p>
<p>
"Suppose we try and get something to take us home by land," suggested
Oaklands; "and leave the boat for some of these good fellows to bring
home, as soon as the weather will allow."
</p>
<p>
"You'll have to walk, sir," replied one of them, civilly; "I don't
believe there's a cart or horse in the place; they all went inland this
morning with fish, and won't return till to-morrow."
</p>
<p>
"There, you hear that," said Lawless, who had just drunk enough to
render him captious and obstinate. "I'm not going to walk to please
anybody's fancy; I see how it is,&mdash;I did not bid high enough. A couple
of guineas for any one who will come with us," added he.
</p>
<p>
"A couple of guineas is not to be got every day," observed a sullen,
downcast-looking man, who had not yet spoken; "and it is not much odds
to me whether I sink or swim now; those custom-house sharks," added he,
with an oath, "look so close after one, that one can't <span class="pagenum">[102]</span>do a stroke
of work that will pay a fellow nowadays. Money down, and I'm your man,
sir," he added, turning to Lawless.
</p>
<p>
"That's the ticket," said Lawless, handing him the money. "I'm glad to
see one of you, at least, has got a little pluck about him. Come along."
</p>
<p>
I could see that Oaklands did not at all approve of the plan, evidently
considering we were running a foolish risk; but, as nothing short of
a direct quarrel with Lawless could have prevented it, his habitual
indolence and easy temper prevailed, and he remained silent. I felt much
inclined to object, in which case I had little doubt the majority of
the party would have supported me; but a boyish dread, lest my refusal
should be attributed to cowardice, prevented my doing so. With the
assistance of the by-standers we contrived to launch our little bark
without further misadventure than a rather heavier sprinkling of salt
water than was agreeable. Rowing in such a sea, however, proved much
harder work than I, for one, had any idea of; we made scarcely any
way against the waves, and I soon felt sure that it would be utterly
impossible for us to reach Helmstone by any exertions we were capable
of making. The weather too was becoming worse every minute: it rained
heavily, and it was with the greatest difficulty we were able to prevent
the crests of some of the larger waves from dashing into our boat; in
fact, as it was, she was already half full of water, which poured in
faster than Coleman (who was the only person not otherwise engaged)
could bale it out.
</p>
<p>
"Upon my word, Lawless, it's madness to attempt to go on," exclaimed
Oaklands; "we are throwing away our lives for nothing."
</p>
<p>
"It certainly looks rather queerish," replied Lawless. "What do you say
about it, my man?" he asked of the person whom he had engaged to steer
us.
</p>
<p>
"I say," replied the fellow in a surly tone, "that our only chance is
to make for the beach at once, and we shall have better luck than we
deserve, if we reach it alive."
</p>
<p>
As he spoke a larger wave than usual broke against the bow of the boat,
flinging in such a body of water that we felt her stagger under it, and
I believed, for a moment, that we were about to sink. This decided the
question; the boat's head was put about with some difficulty, and we
were soon straining every nerve to reach the shore. As we neared the
beach we perceived that even during <span class="pagenum">[103]</span>the short time which had
elapsed since we quitted it, the sea had become considerably rougher,
and the line of surf now presented anything but an encouraging
appearance. As we approached the breakers the steersman desired us to
back with our oars till he saw a favourable opportunity; and the moment
he gave us the signal to pull in as hard as we were able. After a
short pause the signal was given, and we attempted to pull in as he had
directed; but, in doing this, we did not act exactly in concert&mdash;Lawless
taking his stroke too soon, while Mullins did not make his soon enough;
consequently, we missed the precise moment, the boat turned broadside
to the beach, a wave poured over us, and in another instant we were
struggling in the breakers. For my own part, I succeeded in gaining my
legs, only to be thrown off them again by the next wave, which hurried
me along with it, and flung me on the shingle, when one of the group of
fishermen who had witnessed the catastrophe ran in, and seizing me by
the arm, in time to prevent my being washed back again by the under-tow,
dragged me out of the reach of the waves.
</p>
<p>
On recovering my feet my first impulse was to look round for my
companions. I at once perceived Lawless, Mullins, and Oaklands, who were
apparently uninjured, though the latter held his hand pressed against
his forehead, as if in pain; but Coleman was nowhere to be seen. "Where
is Coleman?" exclaimed I.
</p>
<p>
"There is some one clinging to the boat still," observed a by-stander.
</p>
<p>
I looked anxiously in the direction indicated, and perceived the boat
floating bottom upwards, just beyond the line of breakers; while,
clinging to the keel, was a figure which I instantly recognised to be
that of Coleman. "Oh, save him, save him; he will be drowned!" cried I,
in an agony of fear.
</p>
<p>
"Ten guineas for any one who will get him out!" shouted Lawless; but
nobody seemed inclined to stir.
</p>
<p>
"Give me a rope," cried I, seizing the end of a coil which one of the
boatmen had over his shoulder, and tying it round my waist.
</p>
<p>
"What are you going to do?" asked Lawless.
</p>
<p>
While he spoke a large wave separated Coleman from the boat, and, as it
poured its huge volume upon the beach, bore him along with it. With the
swiftness of thought I sprang forward, and succeeded in throwing my
arms round him, ere the next advancing wave dashed over us. And now
my foresight in fastening the rope <span class="pagenum">[104]</span>around me proved, under
Providence, the means of saving both our lives. Though thrown to the
ground by the force of the water I contrived to retain my grasp of
Coleman, and we were hauled up and conveyed beyond the reach of the surf
by the strong arms of those on shore, ere another wave could approach to
claim its victims.

<p>
On recovering my consciousness (I had been partially stunned by the
violence of my last fall) I found myself lying on the beach, with my
head resting on the breast of Oaklands.
</p>
<p>
"My dear, dear Frank, thank God that you are safe!" exclaimed he,
pressing me more closely to him.
</p>
<p>
"What of Coleman?" asked I, endeavouring to raise myself.
</p>
<p>
"They are taking him to the inn," was the reply; "I will go and see if I
can be of any use, now I know you are unhurt; but I could not leave you
till I felt sure of that."
</p>
<p>
"I fancied you seemed in pain just now," said I.
</p>
<p>
"I struck my head against some part of the boat when she capsized,"
returned Oaklands, "and the blow stunned me for a minute or two, so that
I knew nothing of what was going on till I saw you rush into the water
to save Coleman; that roused me effectually, and I helped them to pull
you both out. Frank, you have saved his life."
</p>
<p>
"If it is saved," rejoined I. "Let us go and see how he is getting on; I
think I can walk now, if you will let me lean upon your arm."
</p>
<p>
With the assistance of Oaklands I contrived to reach the inn without
much difficulty; indeed, by the time I got there (the walk having served
in great measure to restore my circulation) I scarcely felt any ill
effects from my late exertions. The inn presented a rare scene of
confusion: people were hurrying in and out, the messenger sent for the
doctor had just returned, breathless, to say he was not to be found; the
fat landlady, in a state of the greatest excitement, was trotting about
making impracticable suggestions, to which no one paid the slightest
attention, while Coleman, still insensible, lay wrapped in blankets
before a blazing fire in the parlour, with the pretty barmaid on her
knees beside him sobbing piteously, as she chafed his temples with some
strong essence.
</p>
<p>
"That's the time of day!" exclaimed Lawless, as his eye fell upon a
printed card which the landlady had just thrust into his hand, headed,
"The directions of the Humane Society for the restoration of persons
apparently drowned". "We shall have it now all right," added he, and
then read as follows: "The first observation we <span class="pagenum">[105]</span>must make, which is
most important, is, that rolling the body on a tub&mdash;"
</p>
<p>
"Bring a tub," cried the landlady eagerly, and off started several of
the by-standers to follow her injunctions&mdash;
</p>
<p>
"Is most injurious," continued Lawless; "but holding up by the legs with
the head downwards"&mdash;(a party of volunteers, commanded by the landlady,
rushed forward to obtain possession of Coleman's legs)&mdash;"is certain
death," shouted Lawless, concluding the sentence.
</p>
<p>
While this was going on I had been rubbing Coleman's hands between
my own, in the hope of restoring circulation; and now, to my extreme
delight, I perceived a slight pulsation at the wrist; next came a deep
sigh, followed by a tremulous motion of the limbs; and, before five
minutes were over, he was sufficiently restored to sit up, and recognise
those about him. After this, his recovery progressed with such rapidity
that ere half an hour had elapsed he was able to listen with interest
to Oaklands' account of the circumstances attending his rescue, when
Lawless, hastily entering the room, exclaimed: "Here's a slice of good
luck, at all events; there's a post-chaise just stopped, returning to
Helmstone, and the boy agrees to take us all for a shilling a head, as
soon as he has done watering his horses. How is Freddy getting on?&mdash;will
he be able to go?"
</p>
<p>
"All right, old fellow," replied Coleman. "Thanks to Fairlegh in the
first instance, and a stiff glass of brandy-and-water in the second,
'Richard's himself again!'"
</p>
<p>
"Well, you've had a near shave for it this time, however," said Lawless;
"there is more truth than I was aware of in the old proverb, 'If you
are born to be hanged, you will never be drowned'; though, if it had
not been for Frank Fairlegh, you would not have lived to fulfil your
destiny."
</p>
<p>
In another ten minutes we were all packed in and about the post-chaise;
Coleman, Oaklands, and myself occupying the interior, while Lawless and
Mullins rode outside. The promise of an extra half-crown induced the
driver to use his best speed. At a quarter before five we were within a
stone's-throw of home; and if that day at dinner Mrs. Mildman observed
the pale looks and jaded appearance of some of the party, I have every
reason to believe she has remained up to the present hour in total
ignorance as to their cause. <span class="pagenum">[106]</span>

<p>
AS I was undressing that night Coleman came into my room, and grasping
my hand with his own shook it warmly, saying: "I could not go to sleep,
Frank, without coming to thank you for the noble way in which you risked
your own life to save mine to-day. I laughed it off before Lawless and
the rest of the fellows, for when I feel deeply, I hate to show it; but
indeed," (and the tears stood in his eyes while he spoke), "indeed I am
not ungrateful."
</p>
<p>
"My dear Freddy," returned I, "do not suppose I thought you so for a
moment; there, say no more about it; you would have done the same thing
for me that I did for you, had our positions been reversed."
</p>
<p>
"I am not so sure of that," was his reply; "I should have wished to
do so; but it is not every one who can act with such promptitude and
decision in moments of danger."
</p>
<p>
<span class="pagenum">[107]</span>"There is one request I should like to make," said I.
</p>
<p>
"What is it?" replied he quickly.
</p>
<p>
"Do not forget to thank Him, whose instrument I was, for having so
mercifully preserved your life."
</p>
<p>
A silent pressure of the hand was the only answer, and we parted for the
night.
</p>
<p>
Owing, probably, to over-fatigue, it was some little time before I went
to sleep. As I lay courting the fickle goddess (or god as the case may
be, for, mythologically speaking, I believe Somnus was a <i>he</i>), I
could not help contrasting my present feelings with those which I had
experienced on the first night of my arrival. Then, overcome by the
novelty of my situation, filled with a lively dread of my tutor, bullied
and despised by my companions, and separated for what I deemed an
interminable period from all who were dear to me, my position was far
from an enviable one.. Now, how different was the aspect of affairs!
With my tutor, who, from an object of dread, had become one of esteem
and affection, I had every reason to believe myself a favourite; I was
on terms of the closest friendship with those of my companions whose
intimacy was best worth cultivating; while with the others I had
gained a standing which would effectually prevent their ever venturing
seriously to annoy me; and, above all, I had acquired that degree of
self-confidence, without which one is alike impotent to choose the good
or to refuse the evil. And it was with an honest pride that I reflected,
that this improvement in my position was mainly owing to a steady
adherence to those principles, which it had been the constant aim of my
dear parents to instil into me from my childhood. I fell asleep at last,
endeavouring to picture to myself the delight of relating my adventures
on my return home; how my mother and sister would shudder over the
dangers I had escaped, while my father would applaud the spirit which
had carried me through them. The vision was a bright and happy one:
would it ever be realised?
</p>
<p>
To our surprise, we learned the next morning that Dr. Mildman had
arrived by the last coach the previous evening, having fortunately met
with Cumberland's uncle at his house of business in town, and delivered
his nephew into his safe custody without further loss of time. The
breakfast passed over without the Doctor making any inquiry how we had
amused ourselves during his absence, nor, as may easily be believed,
did we volunteer information on the subject. On returning to the pupils'
room I found a letter, in my sister's handwriting, lying <span class="pagenum">[108]</span>on the
table. With a feeling of dread for which I could not account, I hastened
to peruse it. Alas! the contents only served to realise my worst
apprehensions. My father's illness had suddenly assumed a most alarming
character, inflammation having attacked the lungs with such violence
that the most active measures had failed to subdue it, and the
physician, whom my mother had summoned on the first appearance of
danger, scarcely held out the slightest hope of his recovery. Under
these circumstances my mother wished me to return home without loss of
time, as my father, before he became delirious, had desired that I might
be sent for, expressing himself most anxious to see me; and the letter
concluded with a line in my mother's handwriting, exhorting me to make
every exertion to reach home without delay, if I wished to find him
alive. For a minute or two I sat with the letter still open in my hand,
as if stunned by the intelligence I had received; then, recollecting
that every instant was of importance, I sprang up, saying, "Where's Dr.
Mildman? I must see him directly."
</p>
<p>
"My dear Frank, is anything the matter? you are not ill?" inquired
Oaklands anxiously.
</p>
<p>
"You have received some bad news, I am afraid," said Coleman.
</p>
<p>
"My father is very ill, dying perhaps," replied I, while the tears,
which I in vain endeavoured to restrain, trickled down my cheeks. After
giving way to my feelings for a minute or two, the necessity for action
again flashed across me.
</p>
<p>
"What time is it now?" inquired I, drying my eyes.
</p>
<p>
"Just ten," replied Oaklands, looking at his watch.
</p>
<p>
"There is a coach which starts at the half-hour, is there not?"
</p>
<p>
"Yes, the Highflyer, the best drag on the road," returned Lawless;
"takes you to town in five hours, and does the thing well too."
</p>
<p>
"I must go by that then," replied I.
</p>
<p>
"What can I do to help you?" asked Coleman.
</p>
<p>
"If you would put a few things into my bag for me, while I speak to the
Doctor," rejoined I.
</p>
<p>
"I will go and get a fly for you," said Lawless, "and then I can pick
out a nag that will move his pins a bit; that will save you ten minutes,
and you have no time to lose."
</p>
<p>
On acquainting Dr. Mildman with the sad intelligence I had received,
and the necessity which existed for me to depart immediately, he at once
gave me his permission <span class="pagenum">[109]</span>to do so; and, after speaking kindly to
me, and showing the deepest sympathy for my distress, said he would not
detain me longer, as I must have preparations to make, but should like
to see me the last thing before I started, and wish me good-bye.
</p>
<p>
I found, on reaching my own room, my carpet-bag already packed:
Coleman and Thomas (whose honest face wore an expression of genuine
commiseration) having exerted themselves to save me all trouble on that
head. Nothing, therefore, remained for me to do, but to take leave of
my fellow-pupils and Dr. Mildman. After shaking hands with Lawless and
Mullins (the former assuring me, as he did so, that I was certain not
to be late, for he had succeeded in securing a trap, with a very spicy
little nag in it, which would have me there in no time) I hastened to
take leave of my tutor. The kindhearted Doctor inquired whether I had
sufficient money for my journey, and, begging me to write him word how I
got home, shook me warmly by the hand, saying, as he did so, "God bless
you, my boy! I trust you may find your father better; but if this should
not be the case, remember whose hand it is inflicts the blow, and strive
to say, 'Thy will be done'. We shall have you among us again soon, I
hope; but should anything prevent your return, I wish you to know that I
am perfectly satisfied with the progress you have made in your studies;
and, in other respects, you have never given me a moment's uneasiness
since you first entered my house. Once more, good-bye; and remember, if
ever you should want a friend, you will find one in Samuel Mildman."
</p>
<p>
The fly-horse proved itself deserving of Lawless's panegyric, and
I arrived at the coach-office in time to secure a seat outside the
Highflyer. After taking an affectionate leave of Oaklands and Coleman,
who had accompanied me, I ascended to my place; the coachman mounted his
box, exactly as the clock chimed the halfhour the horses sprang forward
with a bound, and ere ten minutes had elapsed Helmstone lay at least a
couple of miles behind us.
</p>
<p>
I accomplished my journey more quickly than I had deemed possible, and
had the melancholy satisfaction of reaching home in time to receive my
father's blessing. The powerful remedies to which they had been obliged
to have recourse had produced their effect; the inflammation was
subdued; but the struggle had been protracted too long, and his
constitution, already enfeebled by a life of constant labour and
self-denial, was unable to rally.
</p>
<p>
<span class="pagenum">[110]</span>Having given me a solemn charge to cherish and protect my mother
and sister, he commended us all to the care of Him who is emphatically
termed "the God of the fatherless and widow"; and then, his only earthly
care being ended, he prepared to meet Death, as those alone can do to
whom "to die is gain". When the last beam of the setting sun threw a
golden tint around the spire of the little village church those lips
which had so often breathed the words of prayer and praise within its
sacred walls were mute for ever, and the gentle spirit which animated
them had returned to God who gave it!
</p>
<p>
In regard to this portion of my career, but little more remains to
be told. My father's income being chiefly derived from his church
preferment, and his charities having been conducted on too liberal a
scale to allow of his laying by money, the funds which remained at my
mother's disposal after winding up his affairs, though enough to secure
us from actual poverty, were not sufficient to allow of my continuing an
inmate of an establishment so expensive as that of Dr. Mildman. On being
informed of this change of circumstances the Doctor wrote to my mother
in the kindest manner; speaking of me in terms of praise which I will
not repeat, and inquiring what were her future views in regard to
me; expressing his earnest desire to assist them to the utmost of his
ability. At the same time I received letters from Oaklands and Coleman
full of lamentations that I was not likely to return; and promising, in
the warmth of their hearts, that their respective fathers should
assist me in all ways, possible and impossible. Mr. Coleman, senior, in
particular, was to do most unheard-of things for me; indeed, Freddy more
than hinted that through his agency I might consider myself secure
of the Attorney-Generalship, with a speedy prospect of becoming Lord
Chancellor. I also found enclosed a very characteristic note from
Lawless, wherein he stated, that if I really was likely to be obliged
to earn my own living, he could put me up to a dodge, by which all
the disagreeables of having so to do might be avoided. This infallible
recipe proved to be a scheme for my turning stage-coachman! After citing
numerous examples of gentlemen who had done so (amongst whom the name
of a certain baronet stood forth in high pre-eminence), he wound up by
desiring me to give the scheme my serious attention, and, if I agreed
to it, to come and spend a month with him when he returned home at
midsummer; by the end of which time he would engage to turn me out as
finished a "Waggoner" as ever handled the ribbons.
</p>
<p>
<span class="pagenum">[111]</span>To these letters I despatched suitable replies, thanking the
writers for their kindness, but refusing to avail myself of their
offers, at all events for the present; and I finished by expressing a
hope, that, be my fate in life what it might, I should still preserve
the regard and esteem of the friends whose affection I prized so highly.
</p>
<p>
For some months after my father's death I continued to live at the
rectory; Mr. Dalton, the new incumbent, who had been his curate, and was
unmarried, kindly allowing my mother to remain there till her plans for
the future should be so far arranged as to enable her to determine in
what part of the country it would be advisable for her to reside. It had
been my father's wish and intention, when I should have attained a fit
age, to send me to one of the universities: a wish my mother was most
anxious to carry into effect. In order to accomplish this wish with her
reduced means, it would have been necessary for her, not only to have
practised the strictest economy, but also, in great measure, to have
sacrificed my sister's education, as she would have been utterly unable
to afford the advantage of masters. To this, of course, I would not
consent; after much discussion, therefore, the idea of college was
reluctantly given up, and, as a last resource, my mother applied to an
uncle of hers, engaged in the West India trade, begging him to endeavour
to procure for me a clerkship in some mercantile establishment. She
received a very kind reply, saying that, although he considered me too
young at present to be chained to a desk, he should advise me to apply
myself diligently to the study of French and book-keeping; and ending
by offering me a situation in his own counting-house when I should
be eighteen. As my only alternative lay between accepting this offer
(however little suited to my taste), or remaining a burden upon my
mother, it may easily be imagined that I lost no time in signifying my
desire to avail myself of his kindness; and, ere a couple of months had
elapsed, I had plunged deeply into the mysteries of book-keeping, and
could jabber French with tolerable fluency. I was still working away at
"Double Entry," and other horrors of a like nature, when one morning I
received a large business-like letter, in an unknown hand, the contents
of which astonished me not a little, as well they might; for they proved
to be of a nature once more entirely to change my prospects in life. The
epistle came from Messrs. Coutts, the bankers, and stated that they
were commissioned to pay me the sum of four hundred pounds per annum,
in quarterly payments, for the purpose <span class="pagenum">[112]</span>of defraying my expenses at
college; the only stipulations being, that the money should be used for
the purpose specified, that I did not contract any debts whatsoever,
and that I made no inquiries, direct or indirect, as to the source
from which the sum proceeded. In the event of my complying with these
conditions, the same allowance was to be continued to me till I should
have taken my degree.
</p>
<p>
The immediate consequence of this most unexpected communication was, our
devoting the greater part of a morning to vain speculations as to the
possible source from which this liberal offer might have proceeded.
After guessing every one we could think of, likely or unlikely, we
ended, as is usual in such cases, by becoming decidedly more puzzled
than when we began. The only person with whom I was acquainted,
possessing both the will and the power to do such a thing, was Sir John
Oaklands; but he had already, in the kindest manner, tried to persuade
my mother to allow me to accompany Harry to Trinity College, Cambridge,
begging to be permitted to defray the expenses of my so doing himself;
an offer which she (not choosing to place herself under so heavy an
obligation to a comparative stranger) had, with many expressions of
gratitude, declined. After consulting with our friend Mr. Dalton, it was
decided that I should signify to Messrs. Coutts my readiness to comply
with the required conditions, begging them to convey my best thanks to
my mysterious benefactor, and to inform him that it was my intention
(subject to his approval) to enter my name at Trinity without loss of
time. In answer to this I received the following laconic epistle:&mdash;
</p>
<p>
"Messrs. Coutts beg to inform Mr. Frank Fairlegh, that, in reply to his
favour of the 21st ult., they are desired to state, that the sum of
four hundred pounds per annum will be placed at his disposal whenever he
applies for it".
</p>
<p>
I now resumed my studies under the superintendence of Mr. Dalton, who
had taken a good degree at Cambridge; and, alike delighted at my escape
from the counting-house, and anxious to do credit to my benefactor's
liberality, I determined to make the best use of my time, and worked
<i>con amore</i>. In this manner the next year and a half passed away
without anything worthy of remark occurring. I was happy to perceive
a <span class="pagenum">[113]</span>gradual improvement taking place in my mother's health and
spirits, while Fanny was developing into a very pretty and agreeable
girl.
</p>
<p>
Towards the expiration of this period Mr. Dalton saw fit to take unto
himself a wife, a circumstance which induced my mother to accept the
offer of a cottage belonging to Sir John Oaklands, which was suited to
her limited means. It was situated within the park gates, about a
mile from Heathfield Hall, and, though small, appeared well-built, and
exceedingly pretty.
</p>
<p>
This was an arrangement of which I highly approved, as it enabled me
to renew my intercourse with Harry, who, having left Dr. Mildman's,
was spending a few months at home with his father previous to his
matriculation at Trinity. I found him but little altered in any respect,
save that he had become more manly-looking. For the rest, he was just as
good-tempered, kind-hearted, and, alas! indolent as ever. He informed
me that Lawless also was going to Cambridge, and that Coleman, when
he learned what a party of us there would be, had been most anxious to
accompany us; but his father, unfortunately, did not approve, and he was
now articled to a solicitor, with a view to his succeeding eventually to
his father's practice.
</p>
<p>
Time rolled on, and another three months beheld us duly installed in our
rooms at Trinity, and dividing our time between reading (more or less,
in accordance with our various idiosyncrasies), boating on the Cam,
billiard-playing at Chesterton, <i>et hoc genus omne</i>.
</p>
<p>
Of the details of my college life I shall say but little, a piece of
forbearance for which I consider myself entitled to the everlasting
gratitude of my readers, who, if they have not had their curiosity
on that subject more than satisfied by the interminable narrations of
"Peter Priggins," and his host of imitators, must indeed be insatiable.
Suffice it then to say, that, having from the first determined, if
possible, to obtain a good degree, I made a resolute stand against the
advances of Lawless (who, in consequence of his father's having, for
some reason best known to himself and the Premier, received a peerage,
had now become an "honourable") and the "rowing set," amongst whom, by a
sort of freemasonry of kindred souls, he had become enrolled
immediately on his arrival. After several fruitless attempts to shake my
determination, they pronounced me an incorrigible "sap," and, leaving me
to my own devices, proceeded to try their powers upon Oaklands. They met
with but little <span class="pagenum">[114]</span>success in this quarter, however; not that with
him they had any indomitable love of study to contend with, but that
"all that sort of thing was too much trouble; he really didn't believe
there was a single fellow among the whole lot who had the slightest
appreciation of the <i>dolce far niente</i>". When, however, they found out
that upon an emergency Harry could excel them all&mdash;whatever might be the
nature of the feat to be performed&mdash;and that I could cross a country,
pull an oar, or handle a bat with the best of them, they set us down
as a pair of eccentric geniuses, and as such admitted us to a kind of
honorary membership in their worshipful society; and thus, 'twixt
work and play, the first two years of my residence at Cambridge passed
happily enough.

    CHAPTER XIII &mdash; CATCHING A SHRIMP

"A MIGHTY stupid chapter that last!" "True for you, A reader, but how
was it to be avoided? It was necessary to give you that short summary
of my proceedings, the better to enable you to understand all that is to
follow, and so, don't you see?"
</p>
<p>
"Yes, that will do. Above all things, Master Frank, avoid being prosy;
it is the worst fault an author can fall into."
</p>
<p>
"Reader, you're very cross!"
</p>
<p>
It was towards the close of the long vacation that, one morning as I was
sitting at breakfast with my mother and sister, a note was brought to
me. On opening it, it proved to be from Coleman, whose father had lately
taken a country-house near Hillingford, a small town about fifteen miles
from Heathfield, where he was now about to give a grand ball to all the
neighbourhood by way of house-warming. At this ball Freddy (with whom I
had kept up a constant correspondence, though we had never met since I
left Dr. Mildman's) was most anxious I should be present, and his letter
was really a master-piece of <span class="pagenum">[115]</span>persuasion: not only should I meet
all the beauty and fashion of the county, but he had for some days
past employed himself in paving the way for me with several of the most
desirable young ladies of his acquaintance, who were now, as he assured
me, actually pining to be introduced to me. Moreover, the Honourable
George Lawless had promised to be there; so we were safe for fun of
some sort, Lawless's tastes and habits being about as congenial to
the atmosphere of a ball-room, as those of a bull to the interior of a
china-shop.
</p>
<p>
<span class="pagenum">[115]</span>[These manifold temptations, together with the desire of again
meeting Freddy himself, proved irresistible, and I decided to go.
Oaklands, who had received a similar invitation, was unluckily not able
to accept it, as his father had fixed a shooting-party for that day,
at which, and at the dinner that was to follow, Harry's presence was
indispensable.
</p>
<p>
It was in the afternoon of a glorious September day that I set off
on horseback for Hillingford. I had accompanied the sportsmen in the
morning, and had walked just enough to excite without fatiguing myself;
and now the elastic motion of the horse (a valuable hunter of Sir
John's)&mdash;the influence of the fair scene around me, as I cantered over
the smooth turf of Heathfield Park, and along the green lanes beyond
it&mdash;the prospect of seeing again an old companion of my boyhood's
days&mdash;all contributed to produce in me an exhilaration of spirits which
seemed to raise me above the <i>kleinigkeiten</i>, the little, nesses (as
the Germans so well express it) of this world, and to exalt me to some
higher and nobler sphere. Out of this day-dream I was at length aroused
by the clatter of horses' feet and the rattle of wheels in the lane
behind me, while a man's voice, in tones not of the most gentle
description, accosted me as follows: "Now then, sir, if you've got a
licence to take up the whole road, I'll just trouble you to show it!"
With a touch of the spur I caused my horse to bound on one side, and, as
I did so, I turned to look at the speaker. Perched high in mid-air, upon
some mysterious species of dog-cart, bearing a striking resemblance to
the box of a mail-coach, which had contrived, by some private theory of
development of its own, to dispense with its body, while it had enlarged
its wheels to an almost incredible circumference; perched on the top of
this remarkable machine, and enveloped in a white greatcoat undermined
in every direction by strange and unexpected pockets, was none other
than the Honourable George Lawless! The turn-out was drawn by a pair
<span class="pagenum">[116]</span>of thorough-breds, driven tandem, which were now (their irascible
tempers being disturbed by the delay which my usurpation of the road
had occasioned) relieving their feelings by executing a kind of hornpipe
upon their hindlegs. The equipage was completed by a tiger, so small,
that beyond a vague sensation of top-boots and a livery hat, one's
senses failed to realise him.
</p>
<p>
"Why, Lawless!" exclaimed I; "you are determined to astonish the
natives, with a vengeance: such a turnout as that has never been seen in
these parts before, I'm certain."
</p>
<p>
"Frank Fairlegh, by Jove! How are you, old fellow? Is it my trap you're
talking about? what do you think of it? rather the thing, isn't it, eh?"
I signified my approval, and Lawless continued, "Yes, it's been very
much admired, I assure you;&mdash;quiet, mare! quiet!&mdash;not a bad sort of
dodge to knock about in, eh?&mdash;What are you at, fool?&mdash;Tumble out,
Shrimp, and hit Spiteful a lick on the nose&mdash;he's eating the mare's
tail. Spicy tiger, Shrimp&mdash;did you ever hear how I picked him up?" I
replied in the negative, and Lawless resumed:&mdash;
</p>
<p>
"I was down at Broadstairs, the beginning of the long &mdash;wretched place,
but I went there for a boat-race with some more fellows; well, of
course, because we wanted it to be fine, the weather turned sulky, and
the boat-race had to be put off; so, to prevent ourselves from going
melancholy mad, we hired a drag, and managed to get together a team,
such as it was. The first day we went out they elected me waggoner, and
a nice job I had of it; three of the horses had never been in harness
before, and the fourth was a bolter. It was pretty near half an hour
before we could get them to start; and, when they were off, I had enough
to do to keep their heads out of the shop-windows. However, as soon as
they began to get warm to their work, things improved, and we rattled
along merrily. We were spinning away at about twelve miles an hour when,
just as we were getting clear of the town, we came suddenly upon a covey
of juvenile blackguards who were manufacturing dirt pies right in the
centre of the road. As soon as I saw them I sung out to them to clear
the course, but before they had time to cut away we were slap into the
middle of them. Well, I thought it was to be a regular case of Herod,
and that there would be at least half a dozen of them spifflicated, but
they all managed to save their bacon, except Shrimp&mdash;one of the wheels
went over him and broke him somewhere. Where was it, Shrimp?"
</p>
<p>
<span class="pagenum">[117]</span>"Left arm, sir, if you please," replied Shrimp in a shrill treble.
</p>
<p>
"Ay, so it was," continued Lawless. "As soon as I could contrive to
pull up I sent the groom back, with orders to find a doctor, get the boy
repaired, and tell them to come to me at the hotel in the morning, and
I'd pay for all damages. Accordingly, while I was eating my breakfast
next morning, an amphibious old female in a blue pea-jacket was shown
in to me, who stated she was Shrimp's mother. First, she was extremely
lachrymose, and couldn't speak a word; then she got the steam up,
and began slanging me till all was blue: I was 'an unchristian-like,
hard-hearted, heathen Turk, so I was, and I'd been and spiled her sweet
boy completely, so I had; such a boy as he was too, bless him; it was
quite a sight to hear him say his Catechism; and as to reading his book,
he'd beat the parson himself into fits at it'. Fortunately for me, she
was a little touched in the wind, and, when she pulled up to take breath
for a fresh start, I managed to cut in. 'I tell you what it is, old
lady,' said I, 'there's no need for you to put yourself into a fury
about it; misfortunes will happen in the best-regulated families, and
it seems to me a boy more or less can make no great odds to any one&mdash;no
fear of the breed becoming extinct just at present, if one may judge
from appearances; however, as you seem to set a value upon this
particular boy, I'll tell you what I'll do: I'll <i>buy</i> him of you, and
then, if anything should go wrong with him, it will be my loss and not
yours. I'll give you twenty pounds for him, and that's more than he
would be worth if he was sound.' By Jove, the old girl brightened up in
a moment, wiped her eyes with the sleeve of her coat, and said: 'Five
pounds more, and it's a bargain'. And the end of it all was, the brat
got well before I left the place; I paid the old woman her money, and
brought Shrimp away with me, and it hasn't turned out such a bad spec
either, for he makes a capital tiger; and now I've broken him in, I
would not take twice the money for him. You'll be at old Coleman's hop
to-night, I suppose; so bye! bye! for the present."
</p>
<p>
Thus saying he drew the whip lightly across the leader's back, the
horses sprang forward, and in another moment he was out of sight.
</p>
<p>
Half an hour's ride brought me within view of Elm Lodge, the house
lately taken by Mr. Coleman, senior. As I rang at the bell a figure
leaped out of one of the front windows, and came bounding across the
lawn to meet me, <span class="pagenum">[118]</span>and in another minute my hand was seized and my
arm nearly shaken off by Coleman.
</p>
<p>
"Freddy, old boy!" "Frank, my dear old fellow!" were our mutual
exclamations, as we once more shook hands with an energy which must have
highly edified a pompous footman whom my ring had summoned. After the
first excitement of our meeting had a little subsided we found time to
examine each other more minutely, and note the changes a couple of years
had wrought in us. Coleman was the first to speak.
</p>
<p>
"Why, Frank, how you are altered!" "If you were but decently civil, you
would say 'improved' instead of 'altered,'" replied I; "but you'll
never learn manners."
</p>
<p>
"Oh, if you want compliments I'll soon get up a few, but it strikes me
they are not required. A man with such a face and figure as yours soon
finds out that he is a deucedly good-looking fellow. Why, how high do
you stand?"
</p>
<p>
"About six feet without my boots," replied I, laughing at Coleman, who
kept turning me round, and examining me from top to toe, as if I had
been some newly discovered animal.
</p>
<p>
"Well, you are a screamer, and no mistake," exclaimed he at length.
"Be merciful towards the young ladies tonight, or the floor will be so
cumbered with the heaps of slain that we shall have no room to dance."
</p>
<p>
"Never fear," rejoined I, "the female breast is not so susceptible as
you imagine; and I'll back your bright eyes and merry smile to do more
execution than my long legs and broad shoulders any day."
</p>
<p>
"No soft sawder, Master Frank, if you please; it's an article for which
I've a particular distaste: people never make pretty speeches to one's
face without laughing at one behind one's back afterwards by way of
compensation."
</p>
<p>
"Which rule of course applies to the remarks you have just been making
about me," returned I.
</p>
<p>
"You've caught me there fairly," laughed Coleman; "but come along in,
now, I want to introduce you to my mother and the governor; they are
longing to see you after all I've told them about you, though I can't
say you look much like the thin delicate youth I have described you."
</p>
<p>
Mr. Coleman, who was a short, stout, red-faced old gentleman, with a
bald head and a somewhat pompous manner, came forward and welcomed
me warmly, saying <span class="pagenum">[119]</span>all sorts of complimentary things to me in
extremely high-flown and grandiloquent language, and referring to my
having saved his son's life, in doing which, however, he quite won my
heart by the evident pride and affection with which he spoke of Freddy.
The lady of the house was a little, round, merry-looking woman, chiefly
remarkable (as I soon discovered) for a peculiar mental obliquity,
leading her always to think of the wrong thing at the wrong time,
whereby she was perpetually becoming involved in grievous colloquial
entanglements, and meeting with innumerable small personal accidents, at
which no one laughed so heartily as herself.
</p>
<p>
About half-past nine that evening some of the guests began to arrive,
amongst the foremost of whom was Lawless, most expensively got up for
the occasion in a stock and waistcoat, which, as Coleman observed,
required to be seen ere they could be believed in. As the arrivals
succeeded each other more rapidly, and the rooms began to fill, Lawless
took me by the arm and led me to a corner, whence, unnoticed ourselves,
we could observe the whole scene.
</p>
<p>
"This will be a very full meet, Fairlegh," he began; "I'm getting
confoundedly nervous, I can tell you; I'm not used to this sort of
affair, you know; I used always to shirk everything of the kind, but my
<i>Mater</i> has got it into her head, since she's become 'My Lady,' that
she must flare up and give balls, because 'ladies of rank always do so,'
forsooth; and so she's taken me in hand, to try and polish me up into
something like 'a man of fashion,' as she calls those confounded puppies
one sees lounging about drawing-rooms. Well, as I didn't like to rile
the old woman by refusing to do what she wanted, I went to a French
mounseer, to teach me my paces; I've been in training above a month, so
I thought I'd come here just as a sort of trial to see how I could go
the pace." "This is your <i>debut</i>, in fact," returned I. "My how much?"
was the reply. "Oh, I see, starting for the maiden stakes, for untried
horses only&mdash;that sort of thing&mdash;eh? Yes, it's the first time I've been
regularly entered; I hope I shan't bolt off the course; I feel uncommon
shy at starting, I can assure you."
</p>
<p>
"Oh, you'll do very well when you're once off; your partner will tell
you if you are going to make any mistake," replied I.
</p>
<p>
"My partner, eh? You mean one of those white-muslined young ladies, who
is to run in double harness with me, I suppose?&mdash;that's another sell;&mdash;I
shall be <span class="pagenum">[120]</span>expected to talk to her, and I never know what to say
to women; if one don't pay 'era compliments, and do a bit of the
sentimental, they set you down as a brute directly. What an ass I was to
come here! I wish it was bedtime!"
</p>
<p>
"Nonsense, man; never be afraid!" exclaimed Freddy, who had just joined
us; "I'll pick you out a partner who's used to the thing, and will do
all the talking herself, and be glad of the opportunity of giving
her tongue a little exercise; and here comes the very girl, of all
others&mdash;Di Clapperton." Then turning towards a tall, showy-looking girl,
who had just arrived, he addressed her with&mdash;"Delighted to see you, Miss
Clapperton; a ball-room never appears to me properly arranged till it
is graced by your presence: here's my friend, the Hon. George Lawless,
dying to be introduced to you".
</p>
<p>
"Pleasure&mdash;ar&mdash;dancing&mdash;with you, eh?" muttered the Hon. George, giving
a little quick nod between each word, and getting very red in the face.
</p>
<p>
The young lady smiled a gracious assent, and saying, "I think they
are forming a quadrille&mdash;shall we take our places?" marched him off in
triumph.
</p>
<p>
"Frank, are you provided; or can I do anything for you?" inquired
Coleman.
</p>
<p>
"Who is that interesting-looking girl, with dark hair?" asked I, in
return.
</p>
<p>
"What, the she-male with the white camellia in her head, leaning on the
arm of that old fellow with a cast-iron face? What a splendid pair
of eyes she has got! I'll rind out her name, and get you introduced,"
replied Coleman, disappearing in the crowd. In a minute or two he
returned, and informed me that the young lady's name was Saville.
"You've not made such a bad hit either," continued he; "they tell me
she's to be a great heiress, and old Ironsides there is her guardian.
They say he keeps her shut up so close that nobody can see her; he would
hardly let her come to-night, only he's under some business obligations
to my governor, and he persuaded him to bring her, in order to give me a
chance, I suppose."
</p>
<p>
"What an expression of sadness there is in those deep blue eyes of hers!
I am afraid she is not happy, poor thing!" said I, half thinking aloud.
</p>
<p>
"Why, you're getting quite romantic about it!" returned Coleman; "for
my part, I think she looks rather jolly than otherwise;&mdash;see how she's
laughing with my cousin Lucy; by Jove, how her face lights up when
<span class="pagenum">[121]</span>she smiles!&mdash;she's very decidedly pretty. Well, will you be
introduced?&mdash;they are going to waltz."
</p>
<p>
I signified my assent, and Coleman set off in search of his father to
perform the ceremony, not having courage enough himself to face "old
Stiff-back," as he irreverently termed the young lady's guardian.
</p>
<p>
"I am sorry to refuse your young friend, Mr. Coleman," was the reply to
my introduction; "but Miss Saville never waltzes."
</p>
<p>
"Come, don't be crabbed, Vernor; young people ought to enjoy themselves;
recollect, we were young ourselves once!"
</p>
<p>
"If old Time had dealt as leniently by me as he seems to have done by
you, Coleman, I should consider myself young yet," replied Mr. Vernor.
"I believe I have spoken my ward's wishes upon this point; but, if it
would be more satisfactory to your friend to hear her decision from her
own lips I can have no objection.&mdash;Clara, my dear, this gentleman, Mr.
Fairlegh, does you the honour of wishing to waltz with you."
</p>
<p>
Thus accosted, Miss Saville raised her eyes to my face for a moment,
and, instantly casting them down again, coloured slightly, as she
replied: "If Mr. Fairlegh will excuse me, I had rather not waltz".
</p>
<p>
I could, of course, only bow in acquiescence, and was turning away, when
old Mr. Coleman stopped me with:&mdash;
</p>
<p>
"There, wait a minute, Mr. Fairlegh; my little niece, Lucy Markham, will
be only too glad to console you for your disappointment; she's never so
happy as when she's waltzing".
</p>
<p>
"If you are impertinent, uncle, I'll make you waltz with me till you're
quite tired, by way of punishment!" replied his niece, as she accepted
my proffered arm.
</p>
<p>
During a pause in the waltz I referred to the refusal just received, and
asked my partner (a lively little brunette, with very white teeth and a
bewitching smile) whether her friend Miss Saville were not somewhat of a
prude?
</p>
<p>
"Poor dear Clara&mdash;a prude?&mdash;oh no!" was the reply. "You mean because she
would not waltz, I suppose?"
</p>
<p>
I bowed my head in assent, and she continued:&mdash;
</p>
<p>
"I gave you credit for more penetration, Mr. Fairlegh; did you not see
it was all that horrible Mr. Vernor, her guardian?&mdash;he chose her not to
waltz; and she is too much afraid of him to dare to do anything he does
not approve;&mdash;he would hardly let her come here to-night, only Uncle
Coleman worried him into it".
</p>
<p>
<span class="pagenum">[122]</span>"She is exceedingly pretty," remarked I; "there is something
peculiar in the expression of those beautiful blue eyes which
particularly pleases me; an earnest, trustful look, which&mdash;you will
laugh at what I am going to say&mdash;which I have never seen before, except
in the eyes of a dog!"
</p>
<p>
"Oh! I know so well what you mean," replied my partner; "I have observed
it often, but I never should have known how to express it. What a good
idea!"
</p>
<p>
"May I ask whether you are very intimate with her? Is she an old friend
of yours?"
</p>
<p>
"No, I never saw her till my uncle took this house; but Mr. Vernor
sometimes brings her with him when he drives over on business, and she
comes and sits with me while they are puzzling about their parchments. I
like her so much; she seems as agreeable and good as she is pretty."
</p>
<p>
"How is it," asked I, "that my friend Freddy did not know her by sight
even?&mdash;he had to inquire her name this evening."
</p>
<p>
"Why, Frederick is generally obliged to be in town, you know; and I
have observed that when he is down here Mr. Vernor never brings her with
him."
</p>
<p>
"He had better make a nun of her at once," said I.
</p>
<p>
"Perhaps she won't be a nun!" said, or rather sang Lucy. And here we
joined the waltzers again, and the conversation ended.

<h2>
    CHAPTER XIV &mdash; THE BALL
</h2>
<pre>
          "I could be pleased with any one,
          Who entertained my sight with such gay shows
          As men and women, moving here and there,
          That coursing one another in their steps,
          Have made their feet a tune."
          &mdash;Dryden.

          "And run through fire I will for thy sweet sake."

          "Come now, what... shall we have,
          To wear away this long age of three hours,
          Between our after-supper and bed-time?"
          &mdash;Midsummer Night's Dream.
</pre>
<p>
"By Jove! this is hot work!" exclaimed Lawless, flinging himself down on
a sofa so violently as to make an old lady, who occupied the farther end
of it, jump to an extent which seriously disarranged an Anglo-Asiatic
<span class="pagenum">[123]</span>nondescript, believed in by her as a turban, wherewith she adorned
her aged head. "If I have not been going the pace like a brick for the
last two hours, it's a pity; what a girl that Di Clapperton is to step
out!&mdash;splendid action she has, to be sure, and giving tongue all the
time too. She's in first-rate training, 'pon my word: I thought she'd
have sewn me up at one time&mdash;the pace was terrific. I must walk into old
Coleman's champagne before I make a fresh start; when I've recovered my
wind, and got a mouthful of hay and water, I'll have at her again, and
dance till all's blue before I give in."
</p>
<p>
"My dear fellow," said I, "you must not dance all the evening with the
same young lady; you'll have her brother call upon you the first thing
to-morrow morning to know your intentions."
</p>
<p>
"He shall very soon learn them as far as he is concerned, then," replied
Lawless, doubling his fist. "Let me have him to myself for a quiet
twenty minutes, and I'll send him home with such a face on him that his
nearest relations will be puzzled to recognise him for the next month to
come at least. But what do you really mean?"
</p>
<p>
"That it's not etiquette to go on dancing with one young lady the whole
evening; you must ask some one else."
</p>
<p>
"Have all the bother to go over again, eh? what a treat! Well, we live
and learn; it will require a few extra glasses of champagne to get the
steam up to the necessary height, that's all. And there they are going
down to supper; that's glorious!" and away he bounded to secure Miss
Clapperton's arm, while I offered mine to the turbaned old lady, to
compensate for her late alarm.
</p>
<p>
After supper the dancing was resumed with fresh energy, the champagne
having produced its usual exhilarating effects upon the exhausted frames
of the dancers. Notwithstanding my former repulse, I made a successful
attempt to gain Miss Saville's hand for a quadrille, though I saw, or
fancied I saw, the scowl on Mr. Vernor's sour countenance grow deeper as
I led her away. My perseverance was not rewarded by any very interesting
results, for my partner, who was either distressingly shy, or acting
under constraint of some kind, made monosyllabic replies to every remark
I addressed to her, and appeared relieved when the termination of the
set enabled her to rejoin her grim protector.
</p>
<p>
"Of all the disagreeable faces I ever saw, Mr. Vernor's is the most
repulsive," said I to Coleman; "were I a believer in the power of the
'evil eye,' he is just the sort <span class="pagenum">[124]</span>of looking person I should imagine
would possess it. I am certain I have never met him before, and yet,
strange to say, there is something which appears familiar to me in his
expression, particularly when he frowns."
</p>
<p>
"He is a savage-looking old Guy," replied Freddy, "and bullies
that sweet girl shockingly, I can see. I should feel the greatest
satisfaction in punching his head for him, but I suppose it would be
hardly the correct thing on so short an acquaintance, and in my father's
house too; eh?"
</p>
<p>
"Not exactly," replied I, turning away with a smile.
</p>
<p>
When Lawless made his appearance after supper it was evident by his
flushed face, and a slight unsteadiness in his manner of walking, that
he had carried his intentions with regard to the champagne into effect;
and, heedless of my warning, he proceeded to lay violent siege to Miss
Clapperton, to induce her to waltz with him. I was watching them with
some little amusement, for the struggle in the young lady's mind between
her sense of the proper, and her desire to waltz with an Honourable, was
very apparent, when I was requested by Mrs. Coleman to go in search of a
cloak appertaining to the turbaned old lady whom I had escorted down to
supper, and who, being delicate in some way or other, required especial
care in packing up. Owing to a trifling mistake of Mrs. Coleman's (who
had described a red, worsted shawl as a blue cloth cloak, which mistake
I had to discover and rectify) my mission detained me some minutes. As I
re-entered the ball-room, shawl in hand, I was startled by the crash of
something heavy falling, followed by a shriek from several of the ladies
at the upper end of the room; and on hastening to the scene of action I
soon perceived the cause of their alarm.
</p>

">
</center>

<p>
During my absence Lawless, having succeeded in overcoming Miss
Clapperton's scruples, had recommenced waltzing with the greatest
energy; but unfortunately, after going round the room once or twice,
"the pace," as he called it, becoming faster at every turn, the combined
effects of the champagne and the unaccustomed exercise rendered him
exceedingly giddy, and just before I entered the room he had fallen
against a small table supporting a handsome China candelabrum,
containing several wax lights, the overthrow of which had occasioned
the grand crash which I heard. The cause of the shriek, however, still
remained to be discovered, and a nearer approach instantly rendered it
apparent. One of the wax candles, which had not been extinguished in its
fall, had rolled against the ball-dress of Miss Saville, who happened
to <span class="pagenum">[125]</span>be seated next the table, and set it on fire. After making an
ineffectual attempt to put it out with her hands, she became alarmed,
and as I approached started wildly up, with the evident intention of
rushing out of the room. Without a moment's hesitation I sprang forward,
caught her in my arms, and, flinging the worsted shawl over her dress,
which was just beginning to blaze, enveloped her in it, and, telling her
if she only remained quiet she would be perfectly safe, laid her on the
floor, while I continued to hold the thick shawl tightly down, till, to
my very great delight, I succeeded in extinguishing the flames.
</p>
<p>
By this time several gentlemen had gathered round us, eager with their
advice and offers of assistance. Having satisfied myself that the danger
was entirely over I raised Miss Saville from the ground, and, making way
through the crowd, half led, half carried her to the nearest sofa. After
placing her carefully upon it I left her to the care of Mrs. Coleman and
Lucy Markham, while I sought out the turbaned old lady whose shawl I had
so unceremoniously made use of, and succeeded in making my peace with
her, though, I believe, in her own secret breast, she considered Miss
Saville's safety dearly purchased at the expense of her favourite
whittle. As I approached the sofa again, the following words, in the
harsh tones of Mr. Vernor's voice, met my ear:&mdash;
</p>
<p>
"I have ascertained our carriage is here; as soon, therefore, as
you feel strong enough to walk, Clara, my dear, I should advise your
accompanying me home; quiet and rest are the best remedies after such an
alarm as this".
</p>
<p>
"I am quite ready, sir," was the reply, in a faint tone of voice.
</p>
<p>
"Nay, wait a few minutes longer," said Lucy Markham kindly; "you are
trembling from head to foot even yet."
</p>
<p>
"Indeed I am quite strong; I have no doubt I can walk now," replied Miss
Saville, attempting to rise, but sinking back again almost immediately
from faintness.
</p>
<p>
"Can I be of any assistance?" inquired I, coming forward.
</p>
<p>
"I am obliged to you for the trouble you have already taken, sir,"
answered Mr. Vernor coldly, "but will not add to it. Miss Saville will
be able to proceed with the assistance of my arm in a few minutes."
</p>
<p>
After a short pause the young lady again announced her readiness to
depart; and, having shaken hands with Mrs. Coleman and Lucy Markham,
turned to leave the <span class="pagenum">[126]</span>room, leaning on Mr. Vernor's arm. As I was
standing near the door I stepped forward to hold it open for them, Mr.
Vernor acknowledging my civility by the slightest imaginable motion of
the head. Miss Saville, as she approached me, paused for a moment, as
if about to speak, but, apparently relinquishing her intention, merely
bowed, and passed on.
</p>
<p>
"Well, if it's in that sort of way fashionable individuals demonstrate
their gratitude for having their lives saved, I must say I don't admire
it," exclaimed Coleman, who had witnessed the cool behaviour of Mr.
Vernor and his ward; "it may be very genteel, but, were I in your place,
I should consider it unsatisfactory in the extreme, and allow the
next inflammable young lady who might happen to attract a spark in my
presence to consume as she pleased, without interfering; and peace be to
her ashes!"
</p>
<p>
"It was most fortunate that I happened to have that thick shawl in my
hand," said I; "in another minute her whole dress would have been in
a blaze, and it would have been next to impossible to save her. What
courage and self-command she showed! she never attempted to move after I
threw the shawl around her, till I told her all danger was over."
</p>
<p>
"Very grand, all that sort of thing," returned Freddy; "but for my own
part I should like to see a little more feeling. I've no taste for your
'marble maidens'; they always put me in mind of Lot's wife."
</p>
<p>
"Eh! Mrs. Lot?" interrupted Lawless, coming up to us: "why was she like
me? do you give it up? Because she got into a pretty pickle&mdash;there's
a riddle for you. I say, I made a nice mess of it just now, didn't I?
that's what comes of going to these confounded balls. The fact was,"
he continued, sinking his voice, "the filly bolted with me; she took
uncommon kindly to the champagne at supper; in consequence, she was
so fresh when we started that I couldn't hold her; she kept pushing on
faster and faster, till at last she was fairly off with me; we did very
well as long as we stuck to the open country, but at last we contrived
to get among some very awkward fences; the first stiff bit of timber
we came to she made a rush at, and down we came, gate&mdash;I mean table,
candlestick, and all, a regular smash; and to make matters worse, one of
the candles set the other young woman's petticoat alight."
</p>
<p>
"In fact, after a very severe run, you were nearly being in at the
death," suggested Coleman.
</p>
<p>
<span class="pagenum">[127]</span>"By Jove, it was nothing to laugh at, though!" remarked Lawless;
"she'd have been regularly cooked, if Prank Fairlegh hadn't put her
out when he did, and I should have been tried for 'Unjustifiable
Girl-icide,' or 'Maliciously setting fire to a marriageable female,' or
some such thing; and I daresay the young woman wasn't insured anywhere:
I should have got into a pretty mess; it would have been a worse job
than breaking Shrimp."
</p>
<p>
"Frederick, look here!" cried Lucy Markham, who was passing the place
where we stood; "see how Mr. Fairlegh's sleeve is scorched; surely," she
continued, turning to me, "your arm must be injured."
</p>
<p>
"It begins to feel rather painful," replied I; "but I daresay it's
nothing to signify."
</p>
<p>
"Come to my room," exclaimed Freddy anxiously; "why did you not mention
it before?"
</p>
<p>
"Really I scarcely felt it in the excitement of the moment," returned I;
"it can't be of any consequence."
</p>
<p>
On removing the coat-sleeve, however, a somewhat considerable burn was
apparent, extending about half way from the wrist to the elbow, and
which, the moment it was exposed to the air, became excessively painful.
</p>
<p>
Fortunately, among the guests who had not yet taken their departure was
the surgeon of the neighbourhood, who was speedily summoned, and who,
after having applied the proper remedies, recommended me to carry my arm
in a sling for a few days, at the end of which time, he assured me, it
would cause me little inconvenience.
</p>
<p>
As it was, by great good luck, my left arm which was injured, I
submitted to this mandate with tolerable resignation, and returned to
the drawing-room to be pitied by the tongues of the old, and the bright
eyes of the young ladies, to an extent which (as at that time of day I
was somewhat addicted to the vice of shyness) was more flattering than
agreeable.
</p>
<p>
It was between two and three o'clock when Lawless and I prepared to
take our departure for the inn at which we were to sleep. Being a lovely
night Coleman volunteered to accompany us for the sake of the walk,
telling the servants not to sit up for him, as he had a latch-key in his
pocket&mdash;an article, regarding the possession of which a constant civil
war was carried on between his mother and himself, wherein by dint of
sundry well-contrived stratagems, and deeply laid schemes, he invariably
gained the victory.
</p>
<p>
"I tell you what," said Lawless, "the row and bother, <span class="pagenum">[128]</span>and the
whole kick-up altogether, has made me alarmingly hungry; the only decent
bit of chicken I managed to lay hands on at supper Di Clapperton ate:
precious twist that girl has, to be sure; even after all the ground
she's been over to-night, going a topping pace the whole time too,
she wasn't a bit off her feed; didn't she walk into the ham
sandwiches&mdash;that's all! I'd rather keep her for a week than a fortnight,
I can tell you; she'd eat her head off in a month, and no mistake. Here,
waiter," he continued, "have you got anything to eat in the house?"
</p>
<p>
"Yes, sir, splendid barrel of oysters down by coach last night; capital
brown stout, sir&mdash;real Guinness's!"
</p>
<p>
"That's it, my man," was the rejoinder; "trot 'em out, by all means.
Freddy, old boy," he continued, "come along in with us, and have some."
</p>
<p>
"Well, I don't mind astonishing the natives for once in a way," replied
Freddy; "but it's dreadfully debauched, eating oysters and drinking
porter at this time of day or night, whichever you are pleased to call
it; you'll ruin my morals."
</p>
<p>
"The devil fly away with your morals, and he won't be overloaded
either," was the polite rejoinder; and in we all went together. The
oysters and porter soon made their appearance, and had ample justice
done them; then, as a matter of course, spirits and water and cigars
were produced, "just to prevent the oysters from disagreeing with us";
and we sat talking over old times, and relating various adventures which
had occurred to us since, without troubling our heads about the flight
of minutes. At length Coleman, pulling out his watch, exclaimed: "Past
four o'clock, by the powers! I must be getting to bed&mdash;I've got a lease
to draw to-morrow, and my head won't be over-clear as it is."
</p>
<p>
"Nonsense," replied Lawless; "bed's all a popular delusion; we can't be
better off than we are&mdash;sit still." But on Coleman's persisting in his
wish to depart, Lawless continued: "Well, take another glass, and then
Frank and I will walk home with you, and see you safe, for it's my
belief that you're getting 'screwed.,' or you'd never think of going to
bed". Freddy and I exchanged glances, for if any of our party were in
the condition expressed by the mysterious word "screwed," it certainly
was Lawless himself. After sitting some little time longer, we once more
sallied forth, with the avowed intention of seeing Coleman home. <span class="pagenum">[129]</span>

<h2>
    CHAPTER XV &mdash; RINGING THE CURFEW
</h2>
<pre>
     "If the bell have any sides the clapper will  find 'em."&mdash;
     &mdash;<i>Ben Jonson</i>.

     "&mdash;&mdash;ringing changes all our bells hath marr'd,
     Jangled they have and jarr'd
     So long, they're out of tune, and out of frame;

     They seem not now the same.
     Put them in frame anew, and once begin
     To tune them so, that they may chime all in."
     &mdash;<i>Herbert</i>.

     "Great then are the mysteries of bell-ringing: and this may
     be said in its praise, that of all devices which men have sought
     out for obtaining distinction by making a noise in the world, it
     is the most harmless."
     &mdash;<i>The Doctor</i>.
</pre>
<p>
AS we proceeded through the town Lawless, despite our endeavours to
restrain him, chose to vent his superabundant spirits by performing
sundry feats at the expense of the public, which, had the police
regulations of the place been properly attended to, would have assuredly
gained us a sojourn in the watch-house. We had just prevailed upon him
to move on, after singing "We won't go home till morning" under the
windows of "the Misses Properprim's Seminary for Young Ladies," when
a little shrivelled old man, in a sort of watchman's white greatcoat,
bearing a horn lantern in his hand, brushed past us, and preceded us
down the street at a shuffling trot.
</p>
<p>
"Holloa!" cried Lawless, "who's that old picture of ugliness? Look what
a pace the beggar's cutting along at! what on earth's he up to?"
</p>
<p>
"That's the sexton and bell-ringer," returned Coleman; "they keep up the
old custom at Hillingford of ringing the curfew at daybreak, and he's
going about it now, I suppose."
</p>
<p>
"What jolly fun!" said Lawless; "come on, and let's see how the old
cock does it; "and, suiting the action to the word, off he started in
pursuit.
</p>
<p>
"We'd better follow him," said I; "he'll be getting into some mischief
or other, depend upon it."
</p>
<p>
After running a short distance down the street, on turning a corner
we found Lawless standing under a small arched door-way leading into a
curious old battlemented tower, which did not form part of any church
or other building of the same date as itself, but stood alone,
<span class="pagenum">[130]</span>showing, as it reared its time-worn head high above the more
modern dwellings of which the street was composed, like some giant relic
of the days of old. This tower contained a peal of bells, the fame
of which was great in that part of the country, and of which the
townspeople were justly proud.
</p>
<p>
"All right!" cried Lawless; "the old scarecrow ran in here like a
lamp-lighter, as soon he saw me bowling after him, and has left the key
in the lock; so I shall take the liberty of exploring a little; I've a
strong though undeveloped taste for architectural antiquities. Twopence
more, and up goes the donkey! come along!"
</p>
<p>
So saying, he flung open the door, and disappeared up some steps leading
to the interior of the tower, and, after a moment's hesitation, Coleman
and I followed him.
</p>
<p>
"Don't be alarmed, old boy!" observed Lawless, patting the sexton (who
looked frightened out of his wits at our intrusion) so forcibly on the
back as to set him coughing violently; "we're not come to murder you for
the sake of your lantern."
</p>
<p>
"This gentleman," said Coleman, who by the cunning twinkle of his eye
was evidently becoming possessed by the spirit of mischief, "has been
sent down by the Venerable Society of Antiquaries to ascertain whether
the old custom of ringing the Curfew is properly performed here. He is,
in fact, no other than the Noble President of the Society himself. That
gentleman (pointing to me) is the Vice-President, and I, who have the
honour of addressing you, am the unworthy Secretary."
</p>
<p>
"That's it, Daddy," resumed Lawless, coolly taking up the lantern, and
lighting a cigar; "that's the precise state of the poll, I mean case; so
now go to work, and mind you do the trick properly."
</p>
<p>
Thus adjured, the old man, who appeared completely bewildered by all
that was going on, mechanically took hold of a rope, and began slowly
and at stated intervals tolling one of the bells.
</p>
<p>
"Where are your assistants, my good man?" inquired Coleman after a short
pause.&mdash;The only answer was a stare of vacant surprise, and Coleman
continued, "Why, you don't mean to say you only ring one bell, to be
sure? oh, this is all wrong:&mdash;what do you say, Mr. President?"
</p>
<p>
"Wrong?" replied Lawless, removing the cigar from his mouth and puffing
a cloud of smoke into the sexton's face, "I should just think it <i>was</i>,
most particularly and confoundedly wrong. I'll tell you what it is, old
death's-head and cross-bones; things can't be allowed to go on <span class="pagenum">[131]</span>in
this manner. Reform, sir, is wanting, 'the bill, the whole bill, and
nothing but the bill'. I mean to get into Parliament some day, Fairlegh,
when I am tired of knocking about, you know&mdash;but that wasn't exactly
what I was going to say."
</p>
<p>
"Suppose we show him the proper way to do it, Mr. President!" suggested
Freddy, catching hold of the rope of one of the bells.
</p>
<p>
"Off she goes," cried Lawless, seizing another.
</p>
<p>
"Gentlemen, good gentlemen, don't ring the bells, pray," implored the
old man, "you'll raise the whole town; they are never rung in that way
without there's a fire, or a flood, or the riot act read, or something
of that dreadful natur the matter."
</p>
<p>
But his expostulations were vain. Lawless had already begun ringing his
bell in a manner which threatened to stun us all; and Coleman saying to
me, "Come, Frank, we're regularly in for it, so you may as well take a
rope and do the thing handsomely while we <i>are</i> about it; it would
be horridly shabby of you to desert us now," I hastened to follow his
example.
</p>
<p>
Now it must be known that when I arrived at the inn, before supper,
owing probably to a combination of the fatigue of the day, the
excitement of the evening and the pain of my arm, I felt somewhat faint
and exhausted, and should have greatly preferred going at once quietly
to bed; but, as I was aware that by so doing I should break up the party
I resolved to keep up as well as I could, and say nothing about it.
Finding myself refreshed by the bottled porter, I repeated the dose
several times, and the remedy continuing to prove efficacious, without
giving the thing a thought, I drank more deeply than was my wont, and
was a good deal surprised, when I rose to accompany the others, to
discover that my legs were slightly unsteady, and my head not so clear
as usual. Still I had been far from approving the proceedings of my
companions, and had any one told me, when I entered the tower, that I
was going to ring all the good people of Hillingford out of their beds
in a fright, I should indignantly have repelled the accusation. Now,
however, owing to the way in which Coleman had requested my assistance,
it appeared to my bewildered senses that I should be meanly deserting my
friends the moment they had got into difficulties, if I were to refuse;
but when he used the word "shabby," it settled the business, and,
seizing a rope with my uninjured hand, I began pulling away vigorously.
</p>
<p>
<span class="pagenum">[132]</span>"Now, then, you wretched old beggar," shouted Lawless, "don't
stand there winking and blinking like an owl; pull away like bricks,
or I'll break your neck for you; go to work, I say!" and the miserable
sexton, with a mute gesture of despair, resuming his occupation, a
peal of four bells was soon ringing bravely out over hill and dale, and
making "night horrible" to the startled inhabitants of Hillingford.
</p>
<p>
After the lapse of a few minutes a distant shout was heard; then a
confused noise of people running and calling to each other in the
streets reached our ears; and lastly the sound of several persons
rapidly approaching the bell-tower became audible.
</p>
<p>
"We're in for a scrimmage now, I expect," said Lawless, leisurely
turning up his sleeves.
</p>
<p>
"Not a bit of it," replied Freddy; "only leave it to me, and you'll
see. All you fellows have got to do is to hold your tongues, and keep
on ringing away till your arms ache; trust me to manage the thing all
right. Lawless, keep your eye on ancient Methuselah there, and if he
offers to say a word just knock him head over heels by accident, will
you?"
</p>
<p>
"Aye, aye, sir," replied Lawless, shaking his fists significantly at the
sexton.
</p>
<p>
At this moment a short fat man with a very red face (who we afterwards
learned was no less a person than the mayor of Hillingford in his
public, and a mighty tallow-chandler in his private, capacity) appeared,
attired in a night-cap and greatcoat, and bearing the rest of his
wardrobe under his arm, followed by several of the townspeople, all in
a singular state of undress, and with the liveliest alarm depicted on
their countenances. The worthy mayor was so much out of breath by his
unwonted exertions that some seconds elapsed before he could utter
a word, and in the meantime we continued ringing as though our lives
depended upon it. At length he contrived to gasp out a hurried inquiry
(hardly audible amidst the clanging of the bells) as to what was the
matter. To this Coleman replied by pointing with one hand to a kind
of loop-hole, of which there were several for the purpose of supplying
light and air to the interior of the tower, while with the other hand he
continued ringing away more lustily than before.
</p>
<p>
"Bless my soul!" exclaimed the mayor, raising himself on tiptoe, and
stretching his short neck in a vain endeavour to peep through the
loop-hole, "it must be a fire in West Street!"
</p>
<p>
<span class="pagenum">[133]</span>Two or three of the by-standers immediately rushed into the
street, calling out, "A fire in West Street! send for the engines".
</p>
<p>
At this moment Freddy caught the eye of a tall, gaunt-looking man in a
top-boot and plush breeches, but without coat or waistcoat, and wearing
a gold-laced cocked hat on his head, hind part before, from beneath
which peeped out a white cotton night-cap. Having succeeded in
attracting the attention of this worthy, who in his proper person
supported the dignity of parish beadle, Coleman repeated the same
stratagem he had so successfully practised upon the mayor, save that
in this instance he pointed to a loop-hole in a completely opposite
direction to the one he had indicated previously. The beadle immediately
ran out, muttering ere he did so, "I was certain sure as they was
all wrong".&mdash;In another minute we heard him shouting, "It's in Middle
Street, I tell you, there's a fire in Middle Street!"
</p>
<a name="image-0009"><!--IMG--></a>
<center>
<img src="images/page133.jpg" height="944" width="629"
alt="Page133  Freddy Mystifies the Beadle 
">
</center>

<p>
Coleman now turned to the mayor, who, having somewhat recovered his
breath, was evidently preparing to question the sexton as to the
particulars of the affair, and exclaimed in a tone of deep feeling, "I
am surprised to see a person of your high station standing idle at a
moment like this! take a rope, sir, and lend a hand to assist us, if you
be a man".
</p>
<p>
"To be sure, to be sure," was the reply, "anything for the good of the
town," and, grasping an unoccupied rope, he began pulling away with all
his might.
</p>
<p>
The hubbub and confusion now became something unparalleled&mdash;people
without number kept running in and out of the tower, giving and
receiving all kinds of contradictory orders; volunteers had been
found to assist us, and the whole peal of eight bells was clashing and
clanging away above the tumult, and spreading the alarm farther and
wider; men on horseback were arriving from the country eager to render
assistance; women were screaming, dogs barking, children crying; and, to
crown the whole, a violent and angry debate was being carried on by the
more influential members of the crowd as to the quarter in which the
supposed conflagration was raging&mdash;one party loudly declaring it was in
Middle Street, while the other as vehemently protested it was in West
Street.
</p>
<p>
The confusion had apparently attained its highest pitch, and the noise
was perfectly deafening, when suddenly a shout was raised, "The engines!
clear the way for the engines!" and in another moment the scampering of
the <span class="pagenum">[134]</span>crowd in all directions, the sound of horses' feet galloping,
and the rattle of wheels, announced their approach. While all this was
going on Coleman had contrived silently and unperceived to substitute
two of the by-standers in my place and his own, so that Lawless was the
only one of our party actually engaged in ringing. Seizing the moment,
therefore, when the shout of "The engines!" had attracted the attention
of the loiterers, he touched him on the shoulder, saying, "Now's our
time, come along," and, joining a party who were going out, we reached
the door of the bell-tower unobserved.
</p>
<p>
The scene which presented itself to our view as we gained the open
street would require the pencil of a Wilkie, or the pen of a Dickens, to
describe. The street widened in front of the bell-tower, so as to make
a kind of square. In the centre of the space thus formed stood the
fire-engine drawn by four post-horses, the post-boys sitting erect in
their saddles, ready to dash forward the moment the firemen (who in
their green coats faced with red, and shining leather helmets,
imparted a somewhat military character to the scene) should succeed
in ascertaining the place at which their assistance was required. The
crowd, which had opened to admit the passage of the engine, immediately
closed round it again in an apparently impenetrable phalanx, the
individual members of which afforded as singular a variety of costume
as can well be imagined, extending from the simple shirt of propriety
to the decorated uniforms of the fire-brigade. As every one who had an
opinion to give was bawling it out at the very top of his voice, whilst
those who had none contented themselves by shouting vague sentences
devoid of particular meaning of any kind, the noise and tumult were such
as beggared description. There was one short, stout, red-faced little
fellow (for I succeeded in catching sight of him at last) with a mouth
of such fearful dimensions that when it was open the upper half of his
head appeared a mere lid, whose intellects being still partially under
the dominion of sleep, evidently imagined himself at the Election,
which had taken place a short time previously, and continued strenuously
vociferating the name of his favourite candidate, though the cry of
"Judkins for ever!" did not tend greatly to elucidate matters. Suddenly,
and at the very height of the confusion, the bells ceased ringing, and
for a moment, as if influenced by some supernatural power, the crowd to
a man became silent.
</p>
<p>
The transition from the Babel of sounds I have been <span class="pagenum">[135]</span>describing to
such perfect tranquillity was most striking, and impressed one with an
involuntary feeling of awe. I was aroused by Coleman, who whispered in
an undertone, "The sexton has peached, depend upon it, and the sooner
we're off the better".
</p>
<p>
"Yes, and I'll go in style too; so good-bye, and take care of
yourselves," exclaimed Lawless, and, springing forward, before any
one was aware of his intention, he forced his way through the crowd,
overturning sundry members thereof in his progress, until he reached the
fire-engine, upon which he seated himself with a bound, shouting as
he did so: "Forward, forward! do you want the place to be burnt to
the ground? I'll show you the way; give 'em the spur; faster, faster,
straight on till I tell you to turn&mdash;faster, I say!"
</p>
<a name="image-0010"><!--IMG--></a>
<center>
<img src="images/page135.jpg" height="965" width="636"
alt="Page135 Eloping With the Fire-engine 
">
</center>

<p>
The appearance of authority, coupled with energy and decision, will
usually control a crowd. The firemen, completely taken in by Lawless's
manner, reiterated his orders; the post-boys applied both whip and spur
vigorously&mdash;the horses dashed forward, and, amidst the enthusiastic
cheering of the mob, the engine disappeared like a flash of lightning.
</p>
<p>
"Well, I give the Honourable George credit for that," exclaimed Coleman,
as soon as we had a little recovered from our surprise at Lawless's
elopement with the fire-engine; "it was a good idea, and he worked it
out most artistically; the air with which he waved his hat to cheer them
forward was quite melodramatic. I've seen the thing not half so well
done by several of the greatest generals who ever lived&mdash;gallant
commanders, whom their men would have followed through any amount of the
reddest possible fire during the whole of Astley's campaigns, that is,
if the commissariat department (consisting of the pot-boy stationed at
the side-scenes with the porter) did its duty efficiently."
</p>
<p>
"Freddy, they're beginning to come out from the bell-tower," interrupted
I; "we shall be called upon to answer for our misdeeds if we stay much
longer; see, that long man in the cocked hat is coming towards us."
</p>
<p>
"So he is," returned Coleman; "it strikes me they've found us out;
follow me, and try and look as if it wasn't you as much as possible,
will you?" So saying, he began to make his way out of the crowd
unperceived, an example I hastened to follow; but we were not destined
to effect our purpose quite so easily. The point Coleman wished to gain
was an arched gateway leading into a stable-yard, from which he hoped,
by a foot-path with which he was acquainted, across some fields, to
reach <span class="pagenum">[136]</span>without molestation the inn where I was to sleep. But,
in order to effect this, we were obliged to pass the door of the
bell-tower, from which several people, who appeared angry and excited,
were now issuing. The foremost of those, the cock-hatted official before
mentioned, made his way up to us, exclaiming as he did so:&mdash;
</p>
<p>
"Here, you young gen'lmen, just you stop a bit, will yer? His Wusshup,
the mayor, seems to begin to think as somebody's been a making a fool of
him."
</p>
<p>
"A very natural idea," returned Coleman; "I only wonder it never
occurred to him before; as far as my limited acquaintance with him
will allow me to judge, the endeavour appears to have been perfectly
successful. I wish you a very good-morning."
</p>
<p>
"That's all wery fine, but I must trouble yer to come along o' me; his
Wusshup wants to speak to yer," replied the beadle, seizing Coleman by
the coat-collar.
</p>
<p>
"That is a pleasure his 'Wusshup' must contrive to postpone till he
has caught me," answered Freddy, as with a sudden jerk he succeeded
in freeing himself from his captor's grasp, while, almost at the same
moment, he dealt him a cuff on the side of the head which sent him
reeling back to the door of the bell-tower, where encountering the
mayor, who had just made his appearance, he came headlong to the
ground, dragging that illustrious functionary down with him in a frantic
endeavour to save himself. Profiting by the confusion that ensued Freddy
and I sprang forward, darted through the archway, and, making the best
use of our legs, soon found ourselves in the open fields, and quite
beyond the reach of pursuit.

<h2>
    CHAPTER XVI &mdash; THE ROMAN FATHER
</h2>
<pre>
          "If a dream should come in now to make you afear'd,
          With a wind-mill on his head, and bells at his beard;
          Would you straight wear your spectacles here at your toes,
          And your boots on your brows, and your spurs on your nose?"
          &mdash;<i>Ben Jonson</i>.

          "No&mdash;&mdash;-he
          With more than Roman fortitude is ever
          First at the board in this unhappy process
          Against his last and only son."
          &mdash;<i>The Two Foscari.</i>
</pre>
<p>
DREAMS, ye strange mysterious visions of the soul! Ye wild and freakish
gambolings of the spirit, freed from the incubus of matter, and
unfettered by the control of reason, of what fantastic caprices are ye
the originators <span class="pagenum">[137]</span>&mdash;what caricatures of the various features of our
waking life do ye not exhibit to us, ludicrous and distorted indeed, but
still preserving through their most extravagant exaggerations a wayward
and grotesque likeness to the realities they shadow forth! And stranger
even than your most strange vagaries, is the cool matter-of-fact way in
which our sleeping senses calmly accept and acquiesce in the medley of
impossible absurdities you offer to their notice. We conceive ourselves,
for instance, proceeding along a green lane on horseback; the animal
upon which we are mounted becomes suddenly, we know and care not how,
a copper tea-kettle, and we ride quietly on without testifying, or
even feeling, the least symptom of surprise, as though the identity
of hackneys and tea-kettles was a fact generally recognised in natural
history; the kettle perhaps addresses us, it converses with us on all
the subjects which interest us most deeply; and we discuss our various
hopes and fears, joys and sorrows, loves and hates, with no other
sentiment, save a degree of pleasure at the very sensible and
enlightened views which the utensil takes of the matter. I might
multiply examples, ad infinitum, to illustrate my meaning; but to
those who are familiar with the phenomena alluded to one instance will
suffice; while those who have never experienced them will probably,
at all events, take refuge in disbelief, and lament themselves with a
self-satisfying sorrow over the fresh proof it adduces of the truth of
the Israelitish monarch's aphorism, that "all men are liars ".
</p>
<p>
Be this as it may, my sleep (when, at length, after the excitement I had
undergone, sleep condescended to visit me, which was not until, contrary
to all the rules of good breeding, Somnus had allowed me to call upon
him repeatedly in vain) was disturbed by all sorts and kinds of visions.
Lawlesses innumerable, attended by shoals of top-booted shrimps&mdash;the
visionary shrimp being a sort of compromise between the boy so called
and the real article&mdash;drove impossible dog-carts drawn by quadrupeds
whose heads and necks bore a striking resemblance to the waltz-loving
Diana Clapperton, up and down ball-rooms, to the unspeakable terror
of squadrons of turbaned old ladies. Deafening peals of bells, rung
by troops of Freddy ColeMEN (which I take to be the correct plural
of Coleman), were rousing night-capped nations from their slumbers
in alarm, to whom flocks of frightened mayors were bleating forth
bewildered orders, which resulted in perplexing everybody; and through
it all, mixed up and combined with everything, the pale interesting face
of Clara Saville, <span class="pagenum">[138]</span>characterised by an expression of the deepest
sadness, gazed at me reproachfully out of its large trustful eyes, and
rendered me intensely miserable. From dreams such as these I was
not sorry to be aroused by the sun shining brightly through my
window-shutter; and, on consulting my watch, I found, somewhat to my
surprise, that I had slept till nearly midday.
</p>
<p>
On reaching the breakfast-room my first inquiry was for Lawless, in
reply to which, I was informed that he had returned (on the fire-engine)
about half an hour after I came in; that immediately upon his arrival
he had called for unlimited supplies of rum, lemons, and other suitable
ingredients, wherewith he manufactured a monster brewing of punch in
a washing-tub for the benefit of the firemen, with whom he had somehow
contrived to establish the most amicable relations; he then assisted in
discussing the beverage he had prepared, which appeared to produce no
particular effects until, wishing to rise to return thanks when they
drank his health, he suddenly lost his balance, and being carried to bed
by the waiter and boots, had not yet reappeared. Not liking to disturb
him, I breakfasted alone, and then strolled out to look after Freddy. I
found him sitting in the study, busily engaged in drawing the lease he
had mentioned to us the night before. On seeing me, however, he
sprang up, and, shaking me by the hand, inquired how I was after our
adventures.
</p>
<p>
"That's all right, so far," was his reply to my assurance that my
injured arm was going on favourably, and that I felt no other ill
effects of any kind. "I tell you what," he continued, "my governor's in
no end of a rage about the bell-ringing affair: that old fool of a mayor
recognised me it seems, and vows vengeance, threatening to do all sorts
of things to me, and the governor swears he'll aid and abet him in
anything he chooses to do. They had better take care what they are at,
or they may find I'm not to be bullied with impunity; but come along
into the drawing-room; I don't mind facing the elders now I've got you
to support me; and really, what between my father's accusations and my
mother's excuses, it's as good as a play."
</p>
<p>
"You're abominably undutiful, Master Fred," replied I, as I turned to
follow him.
</p>
<p>
On reaching the drawing-room we found Mr. Coleman standing with his arms
folded with an air of dignified severity, so exactly in the centre of
the hearth-rug that he seemed to belong to the pattern. Seated in a
low arm-chair on the right-hand side of the fireplace was Mrs.
<span class="pagenum">[139]</span>Coleman, apparently absorbed in the manufacture of some mysterious
article of knitting, which constantly required propitiating by the
repetition of a short arithmetical puzzle, without which it would by no
means allow itself to be created. At her feet, engaged in the Sisyphian
labour of remedying the effects of "a great fall" in worsteds, scissors,
and other "articles for the work-table," knelt Lucy Markham, looking
so piquante and pretty, that I could not help wondering how my friend
Freddy contrived to keep himself heart-whole, if, as I imagined, he was
thrown constantly into her society. The party was completed by a large,
sleek, scrupulously white cat, clearly a privileged individual, who sat
bolt upright in the chair opposite Mrs. Coleman, regarding the company
with an air of intense self-satisfaction, and evidently considering the
whole thing got up for her express delectation. Mr. Coleman received me
with pompous civility, hoping I felt no ill effects from my exertions in
the <i>earlier</i> part of the evening&mdash;taking care to lay a marked emphasis
on the word earlier. Lucy acknowledged my presence by a smile and a
slight inclination of the head, but without altering her position.
Worthy Mrs. Coleman, however, jumped up and shook hands warmly with me,
thereby providing Lucy with full employment for the next ten minutes in
picking up the whole machinery of the knitting.
</p>
<p>
"Very glad indeed to see you, Mr. Lawless," commenced Mrs. Coleman.
</p>
<p>
"It's Fairlegh, mother," interposed Freddy.
</p>
<p>
"Yes, my dear, yes, I knew it was Mr. Fairlegh, only I'm always making a
mistake about names; but I never forget a face I have once seen; and
I'm sure I'm not likely to forget Mr. Fairlegh's after the noble way in
which he behaved last night" (here Mr. Coleman turned away with a kind
of ironical growl, and began caressing the cat). "I declare when I saw
him setting Clara Saville's dress on fire, so nicely made as it was
too&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>
<p>
"My dear aunt," remonstrated Lucy, "it was Mr. Lawless who threw down
the candelabrum, and set Clara's frock alight."
</p>
<p>
"Yes, my love, I know, I saw it all, my dear; and very kind it was of
him, I mean afterwards, in speaking to me of it; he said he was so very
sorry about it&mdash;and he called it something funny, poor young man&mdash;'no
end of a something or other '&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>
<p>
"Sell," suggested Freddy.
</p>
<p>
"Oh yes, that was it, no end of a sell. What did he mean by that, my
dear?"
</p>
<p>
<span class="pagenum">[140]</span>"I strongly disapprove," observed Mr. Coleman (who still continued
stroking the cat as he spoke, which process he performed by passing his
hand deliberately from her head, along her back, to the very tip of
her tail, which he retained each time in his grasp for a moment, ere he
recommenced operations), "I highly disapprove of the absurd practice, so
common with young men of the present day, of expressing their ideas
in that low and incomprehensible dialect, termed 'slang,' which, in my
opinion, has neither wit nor refinement to redeem its vulgarity, and
which effectually prevents their acquiring that easy yet dignified mode
of expression which should characterise the conversation of the true
gentleman. In <i>my</i> younger days we took Burke for our model; the
eloquence of Pitt and Fox gave the tone to society; and during our hours
of relaxation we emulated the polished wit of Sheridan; but it is
a symptom of that fearful levelling system which is one of the most
alarming features of the present age; instead of striving to raise and
exalt&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>
<p>
"Really, my dear Mr. Coleman, I beg your pardon for interrupting you,"
cried his wife, "but this is the second time you've lifted my poor
little cat off her hind legs by her tail; and though she's as good as
gold, and lets you do just what you like to her, it can't be pleasant
for her, I'm sure."
</p>
<p>
The only reply to this, if reply it can be called, was an angry "Psha!"
and, turning on his heel, Mr. Coleman strode with great dignity towards
the window, though the effect was considerably marred by his stumbling
against an ottoman which stood in the way, and hurting his shin to
an extent which entailed rubbing, albeit a sublunary and un-Spartan
operation, as a necessary consequence. A pause ensued, which at length
became so awkward that I was about to hazard some wretched commonplace
or other, for the sake of breaking the silence, when Mrs. Coleman
addressed me with:&mdash;
</p>
<p>
"You'll take some luncheon, Mr. Lawless, I'm sure. Freddy, <i>ring the
bell!</i>"
</p>
<p>
"He'll be ready enough to do that," growled Mr. Coleman; "you could not
have asked a fitter person."
</p>
<p>
"Of course he will, a dear fellow," replied Mrs. Coleman; "he's always
ready to oblige anybody."
</p>
<p>
"I disapprove greatly of such extreme facility of disposition," observed
Mr. Coleman; "it lays a young man open to every temptation that comes in
his way; and, for want of a proper degree of firmness and self-respect,
he gets led into all kinds of follies and excesses."
</p>
<p>
<span class="pagenum">[141]</span>"Now, my dear Mr. Coleman," returned his wife, "I cannot bear to
hear you talk in that way; you are too hard upon poor Freddy and his
young friends; I'm certain they meant no harm;&mdash;if they <i>did</i> ring the
bells by way of a joke, I daresay they had drunk rather more champagne
than was prudent, and scarcely knew what they were about; and really all
they seem to have done was to make people get up a little sooner than
usual, and that is rather a good thing than otherwise, for I'm sure if
you did but know the trouble I have sometimes in getting the maids out
of bed in the morning&mdash;and that lazy fine gentleman of a footman too,
he's just as bad.&mdash;Why, what's the matter now?"
</p>
<p>
"I really am astonished at you, Mrs. Coleman," exclaimed her husband,
walking hurriedly across the room&mdash;although this time he took good care
to avoid the ottoman, "encouraging that boy of yours in such scandalous
and ungentlemanly proceedings as those he was engaged in last night!
No harm, indeed! I only hope (that is, I don't hope it at all, for he
deserves to be punished, and I wish he may) that the laws of his country
may think there's no harm in it. Mr. Dullmug, the mayor, intends, very
properly in my opinion, to appeal to those laws; that is a thing, I am
proud to say, no Englishman ever does in vain. You may smile, sir," he
continued, detecting Freddy in the act of telegraphing to me his dissent
from the last doctrine propounded. "You may ridicule your old father's
opinion, but you'll find it no laughing matter to clear yourself,
and justify your conduct, in a court of justice. They may bring it in
conspiracy, for I daresay you plotted it all beforehand; they may bring
it in riot and illegal assembly, for there were three of you engaged in
it; they may bring it in treason, for you incited his majesty's subjects
to commit a broach of the peace, and interfered with the proper officers
in the discharge of their duty: 'pon my word I don't know that they may
not bring it in murder, for the poor child that had the measles in the
town died between six and seven o'clock this morning, and no doubt the
confusion had something to do with accelerating its death. So, sir, if
you're not hanged, you're certain to be transported; and don't ask me
to assist you; I've lived by supporting the law for fifty years, and I'm
not going in my old age to lend my countenance to those who break it,
and set it at nought, though my own son be one of them. I have spoken
my mind plainly, Mr. Fairlegh, more so perhaps than I should have done
before a guest <span class="pagenum">[142]</span>in my own house, but it is a matter upon which I
feel deeply. I wish you good-morning, sir." So saying, he turned away,
and stalked majestically out of the room, closely followed, not to say
imitated, by the cat, who held her tail erect, so as to form a right
angle with the line of her back, and walked with a hypocritical air of
meek dignity and chastened self-approval.
</p>
<p>
"That's what I call pleasant and satisfactory," exclaimed Freddy, after
a pause, during which each member of the party exchanged glances of
consternation with somebody else. "Who would ever have imagined the
possibility of the governor's turning cantankerous&mdash;assuming the
character of the Roman father upon the shortest possible notice, and
thirsting to sacrifice his son on the altar of the outraged laws of his
country! What an interesting victim I shall make, to be sure! Lucy must
lend me that wreath of roses she looked so pretty in last night, to wear
at the fatal ceremony. And my dear mother shall stand near, tearing out
those revered locks of hers by handfuls." (The reader should perhaps
be informed that Mrs. Coleman rejoiced in a false front of so open and
ingenuous a nature, that from its youth upwards it never could have been
guilty of deceiving any one.) "May I ring and tell John to have all the
carving knives sharpened? it would be more satisfactory to my feelings
not to be slaughtered with a blunt weapon."
</p>
<p>
"Don't talk in that way, Frederick," cried Mrs. Coleman. "I'm sure your
father would never think of doing such dreadful things; but I believe
you're only making fun of him, which isn't at all right of you. I'm not
a bit surprised at his being angry with you, when you know how steady
he always says he was as a young man (not that I ever quite believe it,
though); <i>he</i> never went ringing bells, however late he might stay out
at night, that I heard of (though I should never have known it if he
had, very likely). I don't myself see any great harm in it, you know,
Mr. Fairless, particularly after your saving poor Clara Saville, and
Freddy from drowning, when you were all boys together&mdash;indeed I shall
always have the highest opinion of you for it, only I wish you had never
done it at all, either of you, because of making your father so angry,
you I mean, Frederick."
</p>
<p>
"Have you received any account of Miss Saville this morning?" inquired
I, anxious to change the conversation; for I could see that Freddy,
despite his assumed indifference, was a good deal annoyed at the
serious light in which the old gentleman seemed to look upon our
<span class="pagenum">[143]</span><i>escapade</i>. "I should be glad to know that she was none the worse
for all the alarm she must have suffered."
</p>
<p>
"No, we have not heard anything of her," replied Lucy. "Should we not
send to inquire after her, aunt?"
</p>
<p>
"Certainly, my dear Lucy; I am glad you have reminded me; I always meant
to send, only all this has put it out of my head."
</p>
<p>
"Now, Frank, there's a splendid chance for you," exclaimed Freddy;
"nothing can be more correct than for you to call and make the proper
inquiries in person; and then if old Stiff-back should happen not to be
at home, and you can contrive to get let in, and the young lady be not
actually a stone&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>
<p>
"Indeed, Frederick, she is nothing of the kind," interrupted Lucy
warmly; "if you only knew her, you would be astonished to find what deep
warm feelings are concealed beneath that calm manner of hers; but she
has wonderful self-control. I could see last night how much she was
grieved at being obliged to go away without having thanked Mr. Fairlegh
for saving her."
</p>
<p>
"Give her a chance to repair the error to-day, by all means, then,"
said Freddy; "and if you should succeed in gaining an interview, and
she really is anxious to do a little bit of the grateful, and old Vernor
does not kick you downstairs, I shall begin to regret that I didn't
extinguish her myself."
</p>
<p>
"I really have a great mind to follow your advice," returned I; "it is
only proper to inquire after the young lady, and they need not let me in
unless they like."
</p>
<p>
"If you should see her, Mr. Lawlegh," said Mrs. Coleman, "tell her from
me how very much vexed I was about the candelabrum being thrown down and
setting fire to her dress; it was made of the very best Dresden china,
and must have cost (only it was a present, which made it all the more
valuable, you know) fifteen or sixteen guineas; and I'm sure I wonder,
now I come to think of it, why it did not flare up and burn her to
death; but you were so quick and clever, and entirely spoilt that
beautiful whittle of old Mrs. Trottles, with the greatest presence of
mind; and I'm sure we ought all to be thankful to you for it; and we
shall be delighted to see her when she has quite recovered it, tell her,
particularly Lucy, who is nearest her own age, you know."
</p>
<p>
"Let me see," said Freddy, musing; "Mrs. Trottles must be seventy-two if
she is a day; 'pon my word, Lucy, you're the youngest-looking woman
of your age I ever <span class="pagenum">[144]</span>met with; if I had not heard my mother say it
myself, I'd never have believed it."
</p>
<p>
"Believed what, Freddy? What have I said?" asked Mrs. Coleman.
</p>
<p>
"That Lucy was Mrs. Trottles' most intimate friend, because she was
nearest her own age," returned Freddy.
</p>
<p>
"No such thing, sir; I said, or I meant to say&mdash;only you are so tiresome
with your jokes, that you puzzle one&mdash;that Lucy being her own age,
I mean Clara's, Mr. Fairless was to tell her how very glad she would
be&mdash;and very natural it is for young people to like young people&mdash;to see
her; and I hope you'll remember to tell her all I have said exactly, Mr.
Fairless, for I'm always anxious to try to please and amuse her, she's
so very dull and stupid, poor thing!"
</p>
<p>
To perform this utter impossibility I faithfully pledged myself; and,
taking a hasty farewell of the ladies, hurried out of the room
to conceal a fit of laughter which had been gradually becoming
irrepressible.
</p>
<p>
"Laugh away, old boy," cried Freddy, who had accompanied me into the
hall; "no wonder I'm an odd fellow, for, as Pat would say, my mother was
one before me, and no mistake. I wish you luck with the fair Clara&mdash;not
that you'll see her&mdash;old Vernor will take care of that somehow or other;
even if he's not at home, he'll have locked her up safely before he went
out, depend upon it."
</p>
<p>
"You do not mean that in sober earnest?" said I.
</p>
<p>
"Perhaps not actually in fact," replied Freddy, "but in effect I believe
he does. Clara tells Lucy she never sees any one."
</p>
<p>
"She shall see me to-day, if I can possibly contrive it," said I. "Oh
for the good old days of chivalry, when knocking the guardian on the
head, and running away with the imprisoned damsel afterwards, would
have been accounted a very moral and gentlemanlike way of spending the
morning!"
</p>
<p>
"Certainly, they had a pleasant knack of simplifying matters, 'those
knights of old,'" replied Freddy; "but it's not a line of business that
would have suited me at all; in balancing their accounts, the kicks
always appear to have obtained a very uncomfortable preponderance over
the halfpence; besides, the <i>causa belli</i> was a point on which their
ideas were generally in a deplorable state of confusion: when one kills
a man, it's as well to have some slight notion <i>why</i> one does it; and
the case comes home to one still more closely if it's somebody else
who's going to kill you."
</p>
<p>
"You're about right there, Master Freddy," said I, smiling as I shook
hands with him, and quitted the house. %

          "Aye, that's a dolt indeed, for he doth nothing but talk of
          his horse."
          &mdash;<i>Merchant of Venice</i>.

          &mdash;<i>Tempest</i>.
</pre>
<p>
ON arriving at the inn, to which I was forced to return to order my
horse, I perceived Lawless's tandem waiting at the door, surrounded by
a crowd of admiring rustics, with Shrimp, his arms folded with an air of
nonchalant defiance, which seemed to say, "Oh! run over me by all means
if you choose," stationed directly in front of the leader's head. On
entering the parlour I found Lawless busily engaged in pulling on a pair
of refractory boots, and looking very hot and red in the face from the
exertion.
</p>
<p>
"How are you, Fairlegh? how are you? That stupid fool has made 'em too
tight for anybody but Tom Thumb, and be hanged to him. Ever read fairy
tales, Fairlegh? I did when I was a little shaver, and wore cock-tailed
petticoats&mdash;all bare legs and bustle&mdash;'a Highland lad my love was born';
that style of thing, rather, you know; never believed 'em, though:
wasn't to be done even then; eh? Well, this is a puzzler; I can't get
'em on. Where's the fellow they call Boots? Here, you sir, come and see
if you can pull on these confounded namesakes of yours, and I'll tip you
half a crown if you succeed; cheaper than breaking one's back, eh?"
</p>
<p>
"Where are you off to, supposing you should ever get those boots on?"
asked I.
</p>
<p>
"Eh? I am going to call on the young woman I set alight at the hop last
night, and tell her I'm quite down in the mouth about it; explain that
I didn't go to do it; that it was quite a mistake, and all owing to the
other young woman's being so fresh, in fact; and then offer to rig her
out again, start her in new harness from bridle <span class="pagenum">[146]</span>crupper, all at my
own expense, and that will be finishing off the affair handsomely, won't
it?"
</p>
<p>
"I should advise your leaving out that last piece of munificence,"
replied I; "she might think it an insult." "An insult, eh? Oh, if she's
so proud as all that comes to I'd better stay away altogether; I shall
be safe to put my foot into it there, a good deal faster than I have
into these villainous boots&mdash;that's it, Sampson, another pull such as
that and the deed's done," added Lawless, patting the human Boots on the
back encouragingly.
</p>
<p>
"I was just going to ride over to inquire after Miss Saville myself,"
said I.
</p>
<p>
"That's the very thing, then," was the reply. "I'll drive you there
instead; it will be better for your scorched fin (pointing to my injured
arm) than jolting about outside a horse, and you shall tell me what to
say as we go along; you seem to understand the sex, as they call the
petticoats, better than I do, and can put a fellow up to a few of the
right dodges. I only wish they were all horses, and then I flatter
myself I should not require any man's advice how to harness, drive,
train, or physic them."
</p>
<p>
"The ladies are infinitely indebted to you," replied I, as I ran
upstairs to prepare for our expedition.
</p>
<p>
A drive of rather less than an hour and a half, during which the
thorough-breds performed in a way to delight every lover of horseflesh,
brought us to the park gate of Barstone Priory, where Mr. Vernor
resided. After winding in and out for some half-mile amongst groups
of magnificent forest-trees, their trunks partially concealed by
plantations of rare and beautiful shrubs, a sudden turn of the road
brought us in front of the Priory&mdash;an ancient, venerable-looking pile
of building, which had evidently, as its name implied, once belonged to
some religious community. The alterations it had undergone, in order to
adapt it to its present purpose, had been carried out with more taste
and skill than are usually met with in such cases. The garden, with its
straight terrace-walks and brilliant flower-beds, contrasted well
with the grey stone of which the building was composed, while the
smooth-shaven lawn, with an old, quaintly carved sundial in the centre,
and, above all, the absence of any living creature whatsoever, imparted
an air of severe formality to the scene, which, as the eye rested
upon it, seemed to realise all one had read of monastic discipline and
seclusion; and one half expected to see a train of dark-veiled nuns or
sandalled friars winding slowly forth from the hall-door.
</p>
<p>
<span class="pagenum">[147]</span>"What a singular old shop!" exclaimed my companion, regarding the
structure with a look of displeased criticism; "wretched little windows
as ever I saw; they must be all in the dark inside on a dull day, and
every day would be dull if one lived there, I should think. It would
puzzle a fellow to tell whether that building was clerical or lay, fish
or flesh; a castle that had taken a serious turn, or a church out for
the day in plain clothes; how people can like to live in such a mouldy,
rusty, musty old barn, that looks as full of ghosts as a cheese is of
mites, I can't conceive."
</p>
<p>
"There certainly is an appearance of gloom and loneliness about the
place," replied I; "but I think it is chiefly owing to the absence of
any living object&mdash;a herd of deer in the park, a group of children and
dogs playing on the lawn&mdash;anything to give animation to the picture,
would be the greatest improvement."
</p>
<p>
"I should just think it would," returned Lawless. "Fancy a pack of
hounds under that jolly old oak yonder, the huntsman and whips in their
bits of pink, and a field of about fifty of the right sort of fellows
on thorough-breds, dawdling about, talking to one another, or taking
a canter over the turf, just to settle themselves in the saddle; that
would be a sight to make old Vernor look a little better pleased than he
did last night, sing out for his boots and buckskins, and clap his leg
over the first four-footed beast that came in his way, even if it should
happen to be the old cow."
</p>
<p>
"I hope I may be there to see if he does," replied I laughing.
</p>
<p>
On inquiring whether Mr. Vernor was at home we were answered in the
affirmative by a tall, gaunt-looking man-servant, with a stern, not
to say surly, countenance, the expression of which was in some degree
contradicted by a pair of quick, restless little grey eyes, which in
any other face one should have said twinkled merrily beneath the large
grizzled eyebrows which o'ershadowed them.
</p>
<p>
Having, at Lawless's request, procured a nondescript hobbledehoy of
indefinite character to stand at the horses' heads (we had left
Shrimp behind, by common consent, that he might be no restraint on
our conversation), he conducted us across the hall into a kind of
morning-room, fitted up with oak panels, and with a very handsome
old carved oak chimney-piece reaching half-way to the ceiling. He
was leaving the room to inform his master of our arrival when Lawless
stopped him by saying:&mdash;
</p>
<p>
"Here, just wait a bit; tell the young woman&mdash;that is <span class="pagenum">[148]</span>to say,
don't tell her anything; but I mean, let Miss Saville be made aware (I
see you're awake, for all your long face), put her up to our being here;
don't you know, eh?" "Tip him," whispered I.
</p>
<p>
"Eh, stop a bit; you're a very honest fellow, and it's right to reward
faithful servants; and&mdash;you understand all about it, eh?"
</p>
<p>
One portion of this somewhat incoherent address he did understand,
evidently, for without altering a muscle of his face, he put out his
hand, took the money, and left the room with the same unconscious air
of imperturbability which he had maintained throughout the whole
conference. "Good move that, eh?" exclaimed Lawless, as soon as the door
was closed; "that'll fetch her out of her hole, for a guinea. Mind, I
shall do my best to cut you out, Master Frank. I don't see why I haven't
a right to quite as large a share of her gratitude as you have, for if
I hadn't set her on fire you'd never have put her out; so, in fact, she
owes it all to me&mdash;don't you see?"
</p>
<p>
"I'm afraid there's a little sophistry in that argument," replied
I; "but we had better wait till we find whether we shall have the
opportunity afforded us of trying our powers of fascination before we
quarrel about the effects to be produced by them. I cannot say I feel
over sanguine as to the success of your somewhat original negotiation
with that raw-boned giant in the blue plush <i>sine qua nons</i>, as Coleman
calls them."
</p>
<p>
"Time will show," rejoined Lawless, turning towards the door, which
opened at this moment to admit Mr. Vernor; and, alas! him only.
</p>
<p>
His reception of us, though perfectly easy and well-bred, was anything
but agreeable or encouraging. He answered our inquiries after Miss
Saville's health by informing us, cursorily, that no ill effects had
ensued from her alarm of the previous evening. He received Lawless's
apologies with a calm, half-ironical smile, and an assurance that they
were not required; and he slightly thanked me for my obliging assistance
in words perfectly unexceptionable in themselves, but which, from a
peculiarity in the tone of voice more than anything else, impressed one
with a sense of insult rather than of compliment. Still, in compliance
with certain expressive looks from Lawless, who evidently was most
unwilling to be convinced of the failure of his little bit of diplomacy,
I used every means I could think of to prolong the visit. I first
admired, then criticised, the carving of the chimney-piece; I dived
into a <span class="pagenum">[149]</span>book of prints which lay upon the table, and prosed about
mezzo-tint and line engraving, and bored myself, and of course my
hearers also, till our powers of endurance were taxed almost beyond
their strength; and, at last, having completely exhausted not only my
small-talk, but my entire stock of conversation of all sorts and sizes,
I was regularly beaten to a stand-still, and obliged to take refuge
in alternately teasing and caressing a beautiful black and tan setter,
which seemed the only member of the party thoroughly sociable and at his
ease.
</p>
<p>
At length it became apparent even to Lawless himself that the visit
could not be protracted longer, and we accordingly rose and took our
leave, our host (I will not call him entertainer, for it would be a
complete misnomer) preserving the same tone of cool and imperturbable
politeness to the very last. On reaching the hall we encountered the
surly old footman, whose features looked more than ever as if they had
been carved out of some very hard species of wood.
</p>
<p>
"I say, old boy, where's the young lady, eh?" exclaimed Lawless, as soon
as he caught sight of him; "she never showed so much as the tip of her
nose in the room; how was that, eh?"
</p>
<p>
"If she com'd into the room when gentlemen was calling, master would eat
her without salt," was the reply.
</p>
<p>
"Which fact you were perfectly aware of when you took my tip so quietly
just now?"
</p>
<p>
"In course I was, why should I not be?"
</p>
<p>
"Done brown for once, by Jove!" muttered Lawless as he left the hall;
"a raw-boned old rogue, I'll be even with him some day, though&mdash;&mdash;, we
shall see, eh?"
</p>
<p>
While Lawless was busily engaged in settling some of the harness which
had become disarranged the old footman came up to me and whispered,
"Make use of your eyes as you drive through the park, and mayhap you'll
spy some <i>game worth looking after</i>, young gentleman".
</p>
<p>
Surprised at this unexpected address, I turned to question him as to
its meaning, but in vain; for no sooner had he finished speaking than he
re-entered the hall and shut the door behind him.
</p>
<p>
What could he intend me to understand, thought I; he evidently wished
to imply something beyond the simple meaning of the words "game
worth looking after"; could he mean to&mdash;&mdash;no! the thing is
impossible&mdash;"absurd!" exclaimed I, as a wild idea shot through my brain
and I felt myself colour like a girl.
</p>
<p>
<span class="pagenum">[150]</span>"What's absurd?" exclaimed Lawless, gathering up the reins as
he spoke; "what are you talking about? why, you're ranting and staring
about you like a play-actor; what's the matter with you, eh, Frank?"
</p>
<p>
"Nothing," replied I, taking my seat; "don't drive too fast through the
park, I want to look at the view as we go along."
</p>
<p>
In obedience to the gaunt domestic's mysterious injunction I made the
best use of my eyes as we retraced our way through the park, and for my
pains had the satisfaction of beholding a solitary rabbit, half-hidden
under a dock-leaf, and sundry carrion crows.

<h2>
    CHAPTER XVIII &mdash; THE GAME IN BARSTONE PARK
</h2>
<pre>
          "The fringed curtains of thine eye advance and say what
          thou see'st yond."
          &mdash;<i>Tempest</i>.

          Strikes me at heart&mdash;Sir you have well deserved."
          &mdash;<i>As You Like It</i>.
</pre>
<p>
WE had arrived within a quarter of a mile of the gate, and I had just
settled to my thorough dissatisfaction that the old footman must be a
humorist, and had diverted himself by making a kind of April-fool out
of season of me, when, through the trees, which at that spot stretched
their huge branches across the road so as to form a complete arch, I
fancied I perceived the flutter of a woman's dress; and, in another
moment, a turn in the drive disclosed to my view a female form, which I
instantly recognised as that of Clara Saville.
</p>
<p>
Without a minute's hesitation I sprang to the ground before Lawless had
time to pull up, and, saying to him, "I shall be back again directly;
wait for me, there's a good fellow," I hastily entered a winding path,
which led through the trees to the spot where I had seen the young lady,
leaving my companion mute from astonishment. Up to this moment, acting
solely from a sort of instinctive impulse which made me wish to see
and speak to Miss Saville, I had never considered the light in which my
proceedings might appear to her. What right, I now asked myself, had
I to intrude upon her privacy, and, <span class="pagenum">[151]</span>as it were, force my company
upon her, whether she wished it or not? Might she not look upon it as
an impertinent intrusion? As these thoughts flitted through my brain I
slackened my pace; and had it not been for very shame could have found
in my heart to turn back again. This, however, I resolved not to do;
having committed myself so far, I determined to give her an opportunity
of seeing me, and, if she should show any intention of avoiding me, it
would then be time enough to retrace my steps and leave her unmolested.
With this design I proceeded slowly up the path, stopping now and then
as if to admire the view, until a turn of the walk brought me in sight
of a rustic bench, on which was seated the young lady I had before
observed. As soon as she perceived me she rose and turned towards me,
disclosing, as she did so, the graceful form and lovely features of my
partner of the preceding evening. The morning costume, including a
most irresistible little cottage-bonnet lined with pink, was even more
becoming to her than the ball-dress; and when, instead of the cold
air of constraint which had characterised her manner of the previous
evening, she advanced to meet me with a slight blush and the most
bewitching smile of welcome that ever set man's heart beating, I thought
I had never seen anything so perfectly beautiful before.
</p>
<p>
"I must ask your forgiveness for venturing thus to intrude upon you,
Miss Saville," began I, after we had exchanged salutations; "but the
temptation of learning from your own lips that you had sustained no
injury was too strong to be resisted, more particularly after the
disappointment of finding you were from home when I did myself the
pleasure of calling on Mr. Vernor to inquire after you."
</p>
<p>
"Nay, there is nothing to forgive," replied Miss Saville; "on the
contrary," she continued, blushing slightly, "I was anxious to see you,
in order to thank you for the eminent service you rendered me yesterday
evening."
</p>
<p>
"Really it is not worth mentioning," returned I; "it is only what any
other gentleman in the room would have done had he been in my situation;
it was good Mrs. Trottle's shawl saved you; I could have done nothing
without that."
</p>
<p>
"You shall not cheat me out of my gratitude in that way," replied she,
smiling; "the shawl would have been of little avail had it not been so
promptly and energetically applied; and, as for the other gentlemen,
they <span class="pagenum">[152]</span>certainly were very ready with their offers of assistance
<i>after</i> the danger was over. I am afraid," she continued, looking down,
"you must have repented the trouble you had taken when you found what a
thankless person you had exerted yourself to save."
</p>
<p>
"Indeed, no such idea crossed my mind for an instant; the slight service
I was able to render you was quite repaid by the pleasure of knowing
that I had been fortunate enough to prevent you from sustaining injury,"
said I.
</p>
<p>
"You are very kind," was the reply; "but I can assure you I have been
exceedingly annoyed by imagining how wholly destitute of gratitude you
must have considered me!"
</p>
<p>
"Lucy Markham told me such would be the case," replied I, smiling.
</p>
<p>
"Did she?&mdash;a dear warm-hearted girl&mdash;she always does me justice!"
exclaimed Miss Saville, as she raised her beautiful eyes, sparkling with
animation, to my face. She then, for the first time, observed my injured
arm, and added quickly, "but you wear your arm in a sling; I hope&mdash;that
is&mdash;I am afraid&mdash;-I trust it was not injured last night!"
</p>
<p>
"It is a mere trifle," replied I; "he wristband of my sleeve caught
fire, and burnt my arm, but it is nothing of any consequence, I can
assure you."
</p>
<p>
"I am sure you must have thought me sadly ungrateful," returned my
companion; "you exerted yourself, and successfully, to save my life,
receiving a painful injury in so doing, whilst I left the house without
offering you the thanks due even to the commonest service imaginable."
</p>
<p>
"You were not then aware that I had burnt my arm, remember; and forgive
me for adding," returned I (for I saw that she was really distressed at
the idea of my considering her wanting in gratitude), "that it did not
require any unusual degree of penetration to perceive that you were not
altogether a free agent."
</p>
<p>
"No, indeed," replied she, eagerly catching at the idea, "Mr. Vernor,
my guardian&mdash;he always means to be very kind I am sure; but," she added,
sinking her voice, "he is so very particular, and he speaks so sternly
sometimes, that&mdash;I know it is very silly&mdash;but I cannot help feeling
afraid of him. I mention this, sir, to prevent your judging me too
harshly, and I trust to your generosity not to take any unfair advantage
of my openness; and now," she added, fixing her large eyes upon me with
an imploring look which would have melted the toughest old anchorite
<span class="pagenum">[153]</span>that ever chewed grey peas, "you will not think me so very
ungrateful, will you?"
</p>
<p>
"My dear Miss Saville," replied I, "let me beg you to believe I never
dreamt of blaming you for a moment; on the contrary, I pay you no
compliment, but only mention the simple truth, when I tell you that I
admired your behaviour throughout the whole affair exceedingly;
your presence of mind and self-control were greater than, under the
circumstances, I could have supposed possible." As she made no reply
to this, but remained looking steadfastly on the ground, with her head
turned so as to conceal her face, I continued&mdash;"I hope it is unnecessary
for me to add, that you need not entertain the slightest fear of my
making any indiscreet use of the frankness with which you have done me
the honour of speaking to me&mdash;but I am forgetting half my business,"
added I, wishing to set her at ease again, "I am charged with all sorts
of kind messages to you from good Mrs. Coleman and Miss Markham; I
presume you would wish me to tell them I have had the pleasure of
ascertaining that you have sustained no ill effects from your alarm."
</p>
<p>
"Oh yes, by all means," replied Miss Saville, looking up with a pleased
expression, "give my kind love to them both, and tell dear Lucy I shall
come over to see her as soon as ever I can."
</p>
<p>
"I will not intrude upon you longer, then, having delivered my message,"
said I; "I have kept my companion, the gentleman who was so unfortunate
as to overturn the candelabrum, waiting an unconscionable time already;
he is very penitent for his offence; may I venture to relieve his mind
by telling him that you forgive him?"
</p>
<p>
"Pray do so," was the reply; "I never bear malice; besides, it was
entirely an accident, you know. How thoroughly wretched he seemed when
he found what he had done; frightened as I was, I could scarcely help
laughing when I caught a glimpse of his face, he looked so delightfully
miserable," added she, with a merry laugh. After a moment's pause she
continued&mdash;"I'm afraid Mr. Vernor will think I am lost, if he should
happen to inquire after me, and I'm not forthcoming".
</p>
<p>
"Surely," said I, "he can never be so unreasonable as to blame you for
such a trifle as remaining five minutes too long. Does he expect you to
be a nun because he lives in a priory?"
</p>
<p>
"Almost, I really think," was the reply; "and now, good-bye, Mr.
Fairlegh," she continued&mdash;"I shall feel <span class="pagenum">[154]</span>happier since I have been
able to explain to you that I am not quite a monster of ingratitude."
</p>
<p>
"If that is the case, I am bound to rejoice in it also," answered I,
"though I would fain convince you that the explanation was not required."
</p>
<p>
Her only reply to this was an incredulous shake of the head; and, once
more wishing me good-morning, she tripped along the path; and, when
I turned to look again, her graceful figure had disappeared among the
trees.
</p>
<p>
With a flushed brow and beating heart (gentle reader, I was barely
twenty) I hastened to rejoin my companion, who, as might be expected,
was not in the most amiable humour imaginable, having had to restrain
the impatience of two fiery horses for a space of time nearly
approaching a quarter of an hour.
</p>
<p>
"Really, Lawless," I began, "I am quite ashamed." "Oh, you are, are
you?" was the rejoinder. "I should rather think you ought to be, too.
But it's always the way with you fellows who pretend to be steady and
moral, and all that sort of thing: when you do find a chance of getting
into mischief, you're worse a great deal than a man like myself, for
instance, who, without being bothered with any particular principles of
any kind, has what I call a general sense of fitness and propriety, and
does his dissipation sensibly and correctly. But to go tearing off like
a lunatic after the first petticoat you see fluttering among the
bushes in a gentleman's park, and leaving your friend to hold in two
thorough-bred peppery devils, that are enough to pull a man's arms off,
for above a quarter of an hour, it's too bad a great deal. Why, just
before you came, I fully expected when that mare was plunging about on
her hind legs&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>
<p>
"How lovely she looked!" interrupted I, thinking aloud.
</p>
<p>
"You thought so, did you?" rejoined Lawless; "I wish you'd just had to
hold her; her mouth's as hard&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>
<p>
"Her mouth is perfect," replied I emphatically; "quite perfect."
</p>
<p>
"Well, that's cool," muttered Lawless; "he'll put me in a passion
directly;&mdash;pray, sir, may I ask how on earth you come to know anything
about her mouth?"
</p>
<p>
"How do I know anything about her mouth?" exclaimed I. "Did I not watch
with delight its ever-varying expression?&mdash;mark each movement of those
beautiful lips, and drink in every syllable that fell from them?&mdash;not
observe her mouth! Think you, when we have been conversing together for
the last quarter of an hour, that I could fail to do so?"
</p>
<p>
<span class="pagenum">[155]</span>"Oh he's gone stark staring mad!" exclaimed Lawless;
"strait-waistcoats, Bedlam, and all that sort o' thing, you
know;&mdash;conversing with my bay mare for the last quarter of an hour, and
drinking in every syllable that fell from her beautiful lips&mdash;oh, he's
raving!"
</p>
<p>
"What do you mean?" said I, at length awaking to some consciousness of
sublunary affairs&mdash;"Your mare!&mdash;who ever thought of your mare? it's Miss
Saville I'm talking about."
</p>
<p>
"Miss Saville!" repeated Lawless, giving vent to a long whistle,
expressive of incredulity; "why, you don't mean to say you've been
talking to Miss Saville all this time, do you?"
</p>
<p>
"To be sure I have," replied I; "and a very interesting and agreeable
conversation it was too."
</p>
<p>
"Well," exclaimed Lawless, after a short pause; "all the luck in this
matter seem's to fall to your share; so the sooner I get out of it the
better. It won't break my heart, that's one comfort;&mdash;if the young woman
has the bad taste to prefer you to me, why, it can't be helped, you
know;&mdash;but what did she say for herself, eh?"
</p>
<p>
"She sent you her forgiveness for one thing," replied I; and I then
proceeded to relate such particulars of the interview as I considered
expedient; which recital, and our remarks thereupon, furnished
conversation during the remainder of our drive.

     &mdash;<i>Much Ado About Nothing</i>.
</pre>
<p>
ABOUT a week had elapsed after the events which I have just recorded,
when one morning, shortly before my return to Cambridge, I received a
letter from Coleman, detailing the finale of the bellringing affair. It
ran as follows:&mdash;
</p>
<p>
<span class="pagenum">[156]</span>"My Dear Frank&mdash;Doubtless you are, or ought to be, very anxious
to hear how I contrived to get out of the scrape into which you and
the Honourable George managed to inveigle me, having previously availed
yourselves of my innocence, and succeeded, through the seductive medium
of oysters and porter, in corrupting my morals, then leaving me, poor
victim! to bear the blame, and suffer the consequences, of our common
misdemeanour. However, mine is no pitiful spirit to be quelled by
misfortune, and, as dangers thickened around me, I bore up against them
bravely, like&mdash;like&mdash;(was it Julius Cæsar or Coriolanus who did that
sort of thing?) but never mind&mdash;like <i>a</i> Roman brick, we'll say; the
particular brick is quite immaterial, but I must beg you to believe the
likeness was something striking. To descend to particulars.&mdash;Hostilities
were commenced by that old ass, Mayor Dullmug, who took out a summons
against me for creating a riot and disturbance in the town, and the
first day the bench sat I was marched off by two policemen, and locked
up in a little dirty room, to keep cool till their worships were ready
to discuss me. Well, there I sat, kicking my heels, and chuckling over a
heart-rending little scene I had just gone through with my mother, whose
dread of the terrors of the law was greatly increased by the very vague
ideas she possessed of the extent of its powers. The punishment she had
settled in her own mind as likely to be awarded me was transportation,
and her farewell address was as follows: 'If they should be cruel enough
to order you to be transported for fourteen years, Freddy, my dear, I
shall try to persuade your father (though he's just like a savage North
American Indian about you) to get it changed "for life" instead, for
they always die of the yellow fever for the sharks to eat them, when
they've been over there three or four years; and four years are better
than fourteen, though bad's the best, and I'm a miserable woman. I
read all about it last week in one of Captain Marryat's books, and very
shocking I thought it,'&mdash;Having ventured to hint that if I was carried
off by the yellow fever at the end of a year or two, the length of my
sentence would not signify much to me when I was dead, I was rebuked
with 'Don't talk in that shocking way, Frederick, as if you were a
heathen, in your situation, and I hearing you your collect every Sunday,
besides Mrs. Hannah More, who might have been a saint if ever there was
one, or anything else she liked, with her talents, only she was too
good for this wicked world, and so she went to a better, and wrote that
charming book <i>Colebs</i> <span class="pagenum">[157]</span><i>in Search of a Wife</i>'.&mdash;Oh! my poor dear
mother's queer sentences! I was becoming shockingly tired of my own
company, when it occurred to me that it would be the correct thing to
carve my name on the Newgate stone <i>à la</i> Jack Sheppard; and I was
just putting a few finishing strokes to the N of Coleman, wherewith,
in characters at least six inches long, I had embellished a very
conspicuous spot over the chimney-piece, when I was surprised 'with my
chisel so fine, tra la,' (i.e., with a red-hot poker, which I had been
obliged to put up with instead, it being the only implement attainable,)
by the officials, who came to summon me, and who did not appear in the
slightest degree capable of appreciating the beauties of my performance.
By them I was straightway conducted into the awful presence of sundry
elderly gentlemen, rejoicing in heads all more or less bald, and faces
expressing various degrees of solemn stupidity, who in their proper
persons constituted 'the bench'. Before these grave and reverend
signiors did Master Dullmug and his satellites
</p>
<pre>
          "'Then and there,
          Rehearse and declare'
</pre>
<p>
all my heinous crimes, offences and misdemeanours; whereupon the
aforesaid signiors did solemnly shake their bald heads, and appear
exceedingly shocked and particularly puzzled. Well, at last I was called
upon for my defence, and, having made up my mind for some time what line
I would take, I cut the matter very short, by owning to have assisted
in ringing the bells, which I confessed was an act of folly, but nothing
more, and that the idea of its constituting an offence punishable by law
was absurd in the extreme. This sent them to book, and, after turning
over sundry ponderous tomes, and consulting various statutes of all
sorts and sizes, besides whispering together, and shaking their
heads once and again, till I began to fear that their necks would
be dislocated, they arrived at the conclusion that I was right, or
thereabouts. This fact the eldest, most bald, and most stupid of
the party, chosen by common consent, doubtless in virtue of these
attributes, as spokesman, proceeded to communicate to me in a very prosy
harangue, to which he appended a lecture&mdash;a sort of stock article, which
he evidently kept constantly on hand, with blanks which could be filled
up to suit any class of offenders. In this harangue he pointed out the
dangers of juvenile tricks, and the evils of dissipation, winding up
with the assurance that, as I seemed deeply sensible of the error of
my ways, they, the <span class="pagenum">[158]</span>magistrates, would, on my making a suitable
apology to that excellent public functionary, the Mayor of Hillingford,
graciously deign to overlook my misconduct. During his long-winded
address a new idea struck me, and when he had concluded I inquired, with
all due respect, whether 'I was to understand that it was quite certain
I had committed no offence punishable by law?' To this he replied, 'that
I might set my mind completely at ease upon that point; that though,
morally speaking, I had been guilty of a very serious misdemeanour, in
the eye of the law I was perfectly innocent'. 'In that case, gentlemen,'
replied I, 'the liberty of the subject has been infringed; I have been
kept in illegal confinement for some hours, and I believe I have my
remedy in an action for false imprisonment against Mr. Dullmug. Does not
the law bear me out in what I state?' Again they had recourse to their
books, and were unwillingly forced to confess that I was right.' Then,'
continued I, 'so far from making any apology to Mr. Dullmug, unless that
gentleman consents to beg <i>my</i> pardon, and gives me a written apology
for the unjust and illegal prosecution to which he has subjected me,
I shall at once take the necessary steps to proceed against him.' Oh!
Frank, I would have given something to have had you there, old boy!
when I announced this determination; there was such a shindy as I
never before witnessed: old Dullmug was furious, and vowed he'd never
apologise: I declared if he didn't, nothing should prevent me from
bringing my action: the magistrates tried to persuade me, but I was
inflexible; and (by Jove! I was very near forgetting the best part of it
all) my governor, who was in court, the moment he found the law was on
my side, turned suddenly round, swore I had been shamefully used, and
that if it cost him every farthing he possessed in the world, he would
see justice done me. So the end of it was that old Dullmug was forced to
write the apology; it now lies in my writing-desk, and I look upon it
as one of the proudest trophies man ever possessed. So, Master Frank,
considering all things, I think I may reckon I got pretty well out of
that scrape.

"P.S.&mdash;What have you said or done to render old Vernor so bitter against
you? Clara Saville tells Lucy, that, when she informed him of her having
met and conversed with you alone in the park that day, he flew into
<span class="pagenum">[159]</span>such a rage as she had never seen him in before, and abused you
like a pickpocket; and she says she feels certain that, for some cause
or other, he entertains a strong personal dislike to you. <i>Entre nous</i>,
I don't think the fair Clara seems exactly to sympathise with him in
this feeling. Considering that you had somewhat less than half an hour
to make play in, from Lucy's account you do not seem to have wasted much
time. Ah! Master Frank, you are a naughty boy; I can't help sighing when
I reflect, how anxious your poor dear mother must feel about you, when
she knows you're out."
</p>
<p>
"Still the same light-hearted merry fellow as ever," exclaimed I, as I
closed the letter; "how long, I wonder, will those buoyant spirits of
his resist the depressing effect which contact with the harsh realities
of life appears always sooner or later to produce? Strange, what he says
about that Mr. Vernor; I am not conscious that I ever met the man till
the evening of the ball, and yet I fancied there was something which
seemed not utterly unfamiliar to me in the expression of his face.
Vernor! Vernor! I don't believe I ever heard the name before&mdash;it's very
odd. Of course, what he says about Miss Saville is all nonsense; and yet
there was something in her manner, which made me fancy, if I had time
and opportunity&mdash;pshaw! what absurdity&mdash;I shall have enough to do if I
am to imagine myself in love with every nice girl who says, 'Thank you'
prettily for any trifling service I may chance to render her. Î am sure
she is not happy, poor thing! Seriously, I wish I were sufficiently
intimate with her to be able to afford her the advice and assistance of
a friend, should such be ever required by her. I should take the liberty
of asking old Vernor what he meant by his extraordinary behaviour
towards me, were I to see much more of him; there's nothing like a
little plain speaking. But I need, not trouble my brains about the
matter; I shall probably never meet either of them again, so what does
it signify? She certainly is the loveliest girl I ever saw, though!
heigho!" and, with a sigh, for which I should have been somewhat
puzzled rationally to account, I took up my gun, and set off for a day's
shooting with Harry Oaklands. <span class="pagenum">[160]</span>

<p>
TIME, that venerable and much-vituperated individual, who, if he has to
answer for some acts savouring of a taste for wanton destruction&mdash;if
he now and then lunches on some noble old abbey, which had remained a
memorial of the deep piety and marvellous skill of our forefathers&mdash;if
he crops, by way of salad, some wide-spreading beech or hoary
patriarchal oak, which had flung its shade over the tombs of countless
generations, and, as it stood forming a link between the present and the
past, won men's reverence by force of contrast with their own ephemeral
existence&mdash;yet atones for his delinquencies by softening the bitterness
of grief, blunting the sharp edge of pain, and affording to the
broken-hearted the rest, and to the slave the freedom, of the
grave;&mdash;old Time, I say, who should be praised at all events for his
perseverance and steadiness, swept onward with his scythe, and cutting
his way through the frost and snow of winter, once more beheld the dust
of that "brother of the east wind," March, converted into mud by the
showers of April, and the summer was again approaching. It was on a fine
morning in May, that, as Oaklands and I were breakfasting together in my
rooms at Trinity, we heard a tap at the door, and the redoubtable Shrimp
made his appearance. This interesting youth had, under Lawless's able
tuition, arrived at such a pitch of knowingness that it was utterly
impossible to make him credit anything; he had not the smallest particle
of confidence remaining in the integrity of man, woman, or child; and,
like many another of the would-be wise in their generation, the only
flaw in his scepticism was the bigoted nature of his faith in the false
and hateful doctrine of the universal depravity of the human race.
He was the bearer of a missive from his master, inviting Oaklands and
myself to a wine-party at his rooms that evening.
</p>
<p>
"I suppose we may as well go," said Oaklands; "I like a positive
engagement somewhere&mdash;it saves one the trouble of thinking what one
shall do with oneself."
</p>
<p>
<span class="pagenum">[161]</span>"You can accept it," replied I, "but it would be a waste of time
which I have no right to allow myself; not only does it make one idle
while it lasts, but the next day also, for I defy a man to read to any
purpose the morning after one of Lawless's symposia."
</p>
<p>
"Call it supper, my dear boy," returned Oaklands, stretching himself;
"why do you take the trouble to use a long word when a short one would
do just as well? If I could but get you to economise your labour and
take things a little more easily, it would be of the greatest advantage
to you;&mdash;that everlasting reading too&mdash;I tell you what, Frank, you are
reading a great deal too hard; you look quite pale and ill. I promised
Mrs. Fairlegh I would not let you overwork yourself, and you shall not
either. Come, you must and shall go to this party; you want relaxation
and amusement, and those fellows will contrive to rouse you up a bit,
and do you good."
</p>
<p>
"To say the truth," I replied, "that is one of my chief objections to
going. Lawless I like, for the sake of old recollections, and because he
is at bottom a well-disposed, good-hearted fellow; but I cannot approve
of the set of men one meets there. It is not merely their being what
is termed 'fast' that I object to; for though I do not set up for a
sporting character myself, I am rather amused than otherwise to mix
occasionally with that style of men; but there is a tone of recklessness
in the conversation of the set we meet there, a want of reverence for
everything human and divine, which, I confess, disgusts me&mdash;they seem to
consider no object too high or too low to make a jest of."
</p>
<p>
"I understand the kind of thing you refer to," answered Oaklands, "but I
think it's only one or two of them who offend in that way; there is one
man who is my particular aversion; I declare if I thought he'd be there
to-night I would not go."
</p>
<p>
"I think I know who you mean," replied I; "Stephen Wilford, is it not?
the man they call 'Butcher,' from some brutal thing he once did to a
horse."
</p>
<p>
"You're right, Frank; I can scarcely sit quietly by and hear that man
talk. I suppose he sees that I dislike him, for there is something in
his manner to me which is almost offensive; really at times I fancy he
wishes to pick a quarrel with me."
</p>
<p>
"Not unlikely," said I; "he has the reputation of being a dead shot with
the pistol, and on the strength of it he presumes to bully every one."
</p>
<p>
"He had better not go too far with me," returned <span class="pagenum">[162]</span>Oaklands, with
flashing eyes; "men are not to be frightened like children; such a
character as that is a public nuisance."
</p>
<p>
"He will not be there to-night, I am glad to say," replied I, "for I
met him yesterday when I was walking with Lawless, and he said he was
engaged to Wentworth this evening; but, my dear Harry, for Heaven's sake
avoid any quarrel with this man; should you not do so, you will only be
hazarding your life unnecessarily, and it can lead to no good result."
</p>
<p>
"My dear fellow, do I ever quarrel with anybody? there is nothing worth
the trouble of quarrelling about in this world; besides, it would be an
immense fatigue to be shot," observed Harry, smiling.
</p>
<p>
"I have no great faith in your pacific sensations, for they are nothing
more," rejoined I; "your indolence always fails you where it might be
of use in subduing (forgive me for using the term) your fiery temper;
besides, in allowing a man of this kind to quarrel with you, you give
him just the opportunity he wants; in fact you are completely playing
his game."
</p>
<p>
"Well, I can't see that exactly; suppose the worst comes to the worst,
and you are obliged to fight him, he stands nearly as good a chance of
being killed as you do."
</p>
<p>
"Excuse me, he does nothing of the kind; going out with a professed
duellist is like playing cards with a skilful gambler; the chances are
very greatly in his favour: in the first place, nine men out of ten
would lose their nerve entirely when stationed opposite the pistol of
a dead shot; then again, there are a thousand apparent trifles of which
the initiated are aware, and which make the greatest difference, such as
securing a proper position with regard to the sun, taking care that your
figure is not in a direct line with any upright object, a tree or post
for instance, and lots of other things of a like nature which we know
nothing about, all of which he is certain to contrive to have arranged
favourably for himself, and disadvantageously for his opponent. Then,
having as it were trained himself for the occasion, he is perfectly cool
and collected, and ready to avail himself of every circumstance he might
turn to his advantage&mdash;a moment's hesitation in pulling the trigger when
the signal is given, and he fires first&mdash;many a man has received his
death-wound before now ere he had discharged his own pistol."
</p>
<p>
"My dear boy," said Harry, "you really are exciting and alarming
yourself very unnecessarily; I am not going to quarrel with Wilford or
anybody else; I detest <span class="pagenum">[163]</span>active exertion of every kind, and consider
duelling as a fashionable compound of iniquity, containing equal parts
of murder and suicide&mdash;and we'll go to Lawless's this evening, that
I'm determined upon&mdash;and&mdash;let me see&mdash;I've got James's new novel in my
pocket. I shall not disturb you if I stay here, shall I? I'm not going
to talk."
</p>
<p>
Then, without waiting for an answer, he stretched himself' at full
length on (and beyond) the sofa, and was soon buried in the pages of
that best of followers in the footsteps of the mighty Wizard of the
North&mdash;Walter Scott&mdash;leaving me to the somewhat less agreeable task of
reading mathematics.

</pre>
<p>
LET the reader imagine a long table covered with the remains of an
excellent dessert, interspersed with a multitude of bottles of all
shapes and sizes, containing every variety of wine that money could
procure, or palate desire; whilst in the centre stood a glorious
old china bowl of punch, which the guests were discussing in
tumblers&mdash;wine-glasses having been unanimously voted much too slow.
Around this table let there be seated from fifteen to twenty men, whose
ages might vary from nineteen to three- or four-and-twenty; some smoking
cigars, some talking vociferously, some laughing, some though they were
decidedly the minority, listening: but <span class="pagenum">[164]</span>all showing signs of being
more or less elated by the wine they had taken. Let the reader
imagine all this, and he will have formed a pretty correct idea of the
supper-party in Lawless's rooms, as it appeared about ten o'clock on the
evening subsequent to the conversation I have just detailed.
</p>
<p>
"Didn't I see you riding a black horse with one white stocking
yesterday, Oaklands?" inquired a young man with a round jovial
countenance, which might have been reckoned handsome but for the extreme
redness of the complexion, and the loss of a front tooth, occasioned by
a fall received in the hunting field, whose name was Richard, or, as he
was more commonly termed, Dick Curtis.
</p>
<p>
"Yes," replied Oaklands, "I daresay you did; I was trying him."
</p>
<p>
"Ah! I fancied he was not one of your own." "No; he belongs to Tom
Barret, who wants me to buy him; but I don't think he's strong enough to
carry my weight; there's not substance enough about him; I ride nearly
eleven stone."
</p>
<p>
"Oh! he'll never do for you," exclaimed Lawless. "I know the horse well;
they call him Blacksmith, because the man who bred him was named Smith;
he lives down in Lincolnshire, and breeds lots of horses; but they are
none of them, at least none that I have seen, what I call the right
sort; don't you buy him,&mdash;he's got too much daylight under him to suit
you."
</p>
<p>
"Too long in the pasterns to carry weight," urged Curtis.
</p>
<p>
"Rather inclined to be cow-hocked," chimed in Lawless.
</p>
<p>
"Not ribbed home," remarked Curtis.
</p>
<p>
"Too narrow across the loins," observed Lawless.
</p>
<p>
"He'll never carry flesh," continued Curtis.
</p>
<p>
"It's useless to think of his jumping; he'll never make a hunter," said
Lawless.
</p>
<p>
"Only hear them," interrupted a tall, fashionable-looking young man,
with a high forehead and a profusion of light, curling hair; "now
those two fellows are once off, it's all up with anything like rational
conversation for the rest of the evening."
</p>
<p>
"That's right, Archer, put the curb on 'em; we might as well be in
Tattersall's yard at once," observed another of the company, addressing
the last speaker.
</p>
<p>
"I fear it's beyond my power," replied Archer; "they've got such
an incurable trick of talking equine scandal, and taking away the
characters of their <span class="pagenum">[165]</span>neighbours' horses, that nobody can stop them
unless it is Stephen Wilford."
</p>
<p>
The mention of this name seemed to have the effect of rendering every
one grave, and a pause ensued, during which Oaklands and I exchanged
glances. At length the silence was broken by Curtis, who said:&mdash;
</p>
<p>
"By the way, what's become of Wilford? I expected to meet him here
to-night."
</p>
<p>
"He was engaged to dine with Wentworth," said Lawless; "but he promised
to look in upon us in the course of the evening; I thought he would have
been here before this."
</p>
<p>
As he spoke a tap was heard at the room-door.
</p>
<p>
"Well, that's odd," continued Lawless; "that's Wilford for a ducat; talk
of the devil,&mdash;eh, don't you know? Come in."
</p>
<p>
"You had better not repeat that in his hearing," observed Archer,
"though I believe he'd take it as a compliment on the whole; it's my
opinion he rather affects the satanic."
</p>
<p>
"Hush," said Curtis, pressing his arm, "here he is."
</p>
<p>
As he spoke the door opened, and the subject of their remarks entered.
He was rather above the middle height, of a slight but unusually elegant
figure, with remarkably small hands and feet, the former of which were
white and smooth as those of a woman. His features were delicately
formed and regular, and the shape of his face a perfect oval; strongly
marked eyebrows overshadowed a pair of piercing black eyes; his lips
were thin and compressed, and his mouth finely cut; his hair, which was
unusually glossy and luxuriant, was jet black, as were his whiskers,
affording a marked contrast to the death-like pallor of his countenance.
The only fault that could be found in the drawing of his face was that
the eyes were placed too near together; but this imparted a character of
intensity to his glance which added to, rather than detracted from, the
general effect of his appearance. His features, when in repose, were
usually marked by an expression of contemptuous indifference; he seldom
laughed, but his smile conveyed an indication of such bitter sarcasm
that I have seen men, whom he chose to make a butt for his ridicule,
writhe under it as under the infliction of bodily torture. He was
dressed, as was his wont, entirely in black; but his clothes, which were
fashionably cut, fitted him without a wrinkle. He bowed slightly to the
assembled company, and then seated himself in a chair which had been
reserved for <span class="pagenum">[166]</span>him at the upper end of the table, nearly opposite
Oaklands and myself, saying as he did so: "I'm afraid I'm rather late,
Lawless, but Wentworth and I had a little business to transact, and I
could not get away sooner".
</p>
<p>
"What devil's deed have they been at now, I wonder?" whispered Oaklands
to me.
</p>
<p>
"Manslaughter, most likely," replied Archer (who was seated next me, and
had overheard the remark), "Wilford appears so thoroughly satisfied with
himself; that was just the way in which he looked the morning he winged
Sherringham, for I saw him myself."
</p>
<p>
"Send me down the claret, will you, Curtis?" asked Wilford. "Punch is a
beverage I don't patronise; it makes a man's hand shaky."
</p>
<p>
"If that is the case," returned Archer, "you ought to make a point of
drinking it for the good of society, my dear Wilford; let me help you to
a glass."
</p>
<p>
"Nonsense, Archer, be quiet, man; here, taste this cool bottle, Wilford;
claret's good for nothing if it's at all flat," exclaimed Lawless,
drawing the cork of a fresh magnum as he spoke.
</p>
<p>
"I differ from you in that opinion, Archer," returned Wilford, fixing
his keen black eyes upon the person he addressed with a piercing glance;
"society is like the wine in this glass," and he filled a bumper to
the brim with claret as he spoke; "it requires a steady hand to keep
it within its proper bounds, and to compel it to preserve an unruffled
surface"; and so saying he raised the glass to his lips without spilling
a drop, still keeping his eyes fixed upon Archer's face with the same
withering glance.
</p>
<p>
"Well, I have often heard of looking daggers at a person," continued
Archer, who had been drinking somewhat deeply during the evening, and
now appeared possessed by a spirit of mischief leading him to tease and
annoy Wilford in every way he could think of; "but Wilford does
worse, he positively looks pistols&mdash;cocked and loaded pistols&mdash;at one.
Fairlegh, I shall screen myself behind your broad shoulders; I never
could stand fire." So saying he seized me by the elbows, and, urging me
forward, crouched down behind me, affecting the extremity of terror.
</p>
<p>
The scowl on Wilford's brow deepened as he spoke, but, after a moment's
hesitation, apparently considering the affair too absurd to take notice
of, he turned away with a contemptuous smile, saying, "You make your
punch too strong, Lawless".
</p>
<p>
Archer instantly recovered his erect attitude, and with <span class="pagenum">[167]</span>a flushed
face seemed about to make some angry reply, when Lawless, who appeared
nervously anxious that the evening should pass over harmoniously,
interposed.
</p>
<p>
"Archer, you're absolutely incorrigible; keep him in order, Fairlegh,
eh? give him some more punch, and fill your own glass&mdash;it has been
empty I don't know how long. I'll find a toast that will make you
drink&mdash;bumpers round, gentlemen, 'to the health of the prettiest girl in
Hertfordshire'. Are you all charged? I beg to propose

</center>

<p>
"Excuse my interrupting you, Lawless," exclaimed I&mdash;for I felt certain
who it was he was thinking of; and the idea of Miss Saville's name
being mentioned and discussed with the tone of licence common on such
occasions, appeared to me such complete profanation, that I determined,
be the consequences what they might, to prevent it&mdash;"Excuse my
interrupting you, but I should feel greatly obliged by your substituting
some other toast for the one you are about to propose".
</p>
<p>
"Eh, what! not drink the young woman's health? why I thought you admired
her more than I do: not drink her health? how's that, eh?"
</p>
<p>
"I shall be most happy to explain to you the reasons for my request at
some other time," replied I; "at present I can only add that I shall
consider it as a personal favour if you will accede to it."
</p>
<p>
"It does not appear to me to require an OEdipus to discover Mr.
Fairlegh's reasons for this request," observed Stephen Wilford; "he
evidently does not consider the present company deserving of the high
honour of drinking the health of a young lady whom <i>he</i> distinguishes by
his admiration."
</p>
<p>
"Not over-flattering, I must say," muttered Lawless, looking annoyed.
</p>
<p>
"I suppose he's afraid of our hearing her name, lest some of us should
go and cut him out," suggested Curtis in an undertone, which was,
however, perfectly audible.
</p>
<p>
"In the meanwhile, Lawless, I hope you're not going to indulge your
friend's caprice at the expense of the rest of the company," resumed
Wilford; "having raised our expectations you are bound to gratify them."
</p>
<p>
Lawless, who evidently hesitated between his desire to assert his
independence and his wish to oblige me, was beginning with his usual,
"Eh? why, don't you see,"&mdash;when I interrupted him by saying, "Allow me to
set this matter at rest in a very few words. Lawless, I hope, knows me
well enough to feel sure that I could not <span class="pagenum">[168]</span>intend any disrespect
either to himself or to his guests&mdash;I believe it is not such an
unheard-of thing for a gentle-man to object to the name of any lady
whom he respects being commented upon with the freedom incidental to a
convivial meeting like the present&mdash;however that may be, I have asked
Lawless as a favour not to drink a certain toast in my presence; should
he be unwilling to comply with my request, as I would not wish to be
the slightest restraint upon him at his own table, I shall request his
permission to withdraw; on this point I await his decision. I have only
one more observation to make," continued I, looking at Wilford, who was
evidently preparing to speak, "which is, that if, after what I have just
said, any gentleman should continue to urge Lawless to give the toast to
which I object, I must perforce consider that he wishes to insult me."
</p>
<p>
As I concluded, there was a murmur of applause, and Archer and one or
two others turned to Lawless, declaring it was quite impossible to
press the matter further after what I had said; when Wilford, in a cold,
sarcastic tone of voice, observed: "I am sorry Mr. Fairlegh's <i>last</i>
argument should have failed in convincing me, as easily as it seems to
have done some others of the party; such, however, unfortunately being
the case, I must repeat, even at the risk of incurring a thing so
terrible as that gentleman's displeasure, my decided opinion that
Lawless, having informed us he was going to drink a particular toast,
should not allow himself to be bullied out of it, in compliance with any
man's humour".
</p>
<p>
This speech, as it might be expected, produced great excitement; I
sprang to my feet (an example followed by several of the party), and was
about to make an angry reply, when Oaklands, who up to this moment had
taken no part in the discussion, but sat sipping his wine with his usual
air of listless contentment, apparently indifferent to, if not wholly
unconscious of, all that was going on, now rose from his seat, and
having obtained silence said: "Really, gentlemen, all this confusion
appears to me very unnecessary, when a word from our host will end it.
Fairlegh has asked you not to propose a certain toast; it only remains
for you, Lawless, to say, whether you intend to do so or not."
</p>
<p>
Thus urged, Lawless replied, "Eh? no, certainly not; Frank Fairlegh's
a trump, and I would not do anything to annoy him for more than I can
tell: besides, when I come to think of it, I believe he was right, and
I was wrong&mdash;but you see, women are a kind of cattle I don't clearly
understand&mdash;if it was a horse now&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>
<p>
<span class="pagenum">[169]</span>A burst of laughter at this characteristic remark drowned the
conclusion of the speech, but the announcement that the toast was given
up appeared to produce general satisfaction; for, since I had spoken,
the popular opinion had been decidedly in my favour.
</p>
<p>
"The cause of this little interruption to the harmony of the evening
being removed," resumed Oaklands, "suppose we see whether its effects
may not as easily be got rid of. Every man, I take it, has a right to
express his own opinion, and I think Fairlegh must allow that he was a
little hasty in presupposing, that by so doing an insult was intended.
This being the case, he will, I am sure, agree with me that he ought not
to take any notice of Mr. Wilford's remark."
</p>
<p>
"Yes, to be sure, that's it&mdash;all right, eh?" exclaimed Lawless; "come,
Fairlegh, as a favour to me, let the matter end here."
</p>
<p>
Thus urged, I could only reply, that "I was quite willing to defer to
their judgment, and do whatever they considered right "&mdash;and as Wilford
(though I could see that he was annoyed beyond measure at having failed
in persuading Lawless to give the toast) remained silent, merely curling
his lip contemptuously when I spoke, here the affair ended.
</p>
<p>
As soon as the conversation became general Oaklands turned to me with
a mischievous smile, and asked, in an undertone, "Pray, Master Frank,
what's become of all the wisdom and prudence recommended to me this
morning? I am afraid you quite exhausted your stock, and have not
reserved any for your own use. Who's the fire-eater now, I wonder?"
</p>
<p>
"Laugh away, Harry; I may have acted foolishly, as is usually the case
where one acts entirely from impulse; but I could not have sat tamely
by and heard Clara Saville's name polluted by the-remarks of such men
as Curtis and Wilford&mdash;I should have got into a row with them sooner or
later, and it was better to check the thing at once."
</p>
<p>
"My dear boy," returned Oaklands, "do not imagine for a moment that I
am inclined to blame you; the only thing that I could not help feeling
rather amused at, was your throwing down the gauntlet to the gentleman
opposite, when I recollected a certain lecture on prudence, with which I
was victimised this morning."
</p>
<p>
"As you are strong, be merciful," replied I; "and, whenever I do a
foolish thing, may I always have such a friend at hand to save me from
the consequences."
</p>
<p>
<span class="pagenum">[170]</span>"That's a toast I will drink most willingly," said Oaklands
smiling; "the more so, as it reverses the position in which we generally
stand with regard to each other, the alteration being decidedly in my
favour; but&mdash;" he continued, interrupting himself, "what on earth are
they laughing at, and making such a row about?"
</p>
<p>
"Oh, it's merely Curtis romancing with the most unmitigated effrontery,
about something that neither he, nor any one else, ever did out
hunting," replied Archer; "a tremendous leap, I fancy it was."
</p>
<p>
"Do not be too sure that it is impossible," replied I; "a horse once
cleared the mouth of a chalk pit with me on its back, when I was a boy;
Lawless remembers it." "Eh! what? Mad Bess!" returned Lawless; "I should
think I did too; I rode there afterwards and examined the place&mdash;a
regular break-neck-looking hole as ever I saw in my life. Tell 'em about
it, Frank."
</p>
<p>
Thus called upon, no choice was left me but to commence the recital,
which, although there are few things to which I have a greater objection
than being the hero of my own story, I accordingly did. Several remarks
were made as I concluded, but, owing either to my well-known dislike of
exaggeration, or to the air of truthfulness with which I had told the
tale, nobody seemed inclined to doubt that the adventure had occurred in
the manner I related, although it was of a more incredible nature than
the feat Curtis had recounted. This fact had just excited my attention,
when Wilford, turning to the man on his right hand, observed: "It's
a great pity that some one hasn't taken notes of this evening's
conversation; they would have afforded materials for a new volume of the
adventures of Baron Munchausen".
</p>
<p>
My only answer to this remark, which was evidently intended for my
hearing, was a slight smile, for I had determined I would not again be
betrayed into any altercation with him, and, being now on my guard,
I felt pretty sure of being able to maintain my resolution. To my
annoyance Oaklands replied: "If your remark is intended to throw any
discredit upon the truth of the anecdote my friend has related, I
must be excused for observing that Lawless and I, though not actually
eyewitnesses of the leap, are yet perfectly aware that it took place".
</p>
<p>
"Was that observation addressed to me, Mr. Oaklands?" inquired Wilford,
regarding Oaklands with an insolent stare.
</p>
<p>
<span class="pagenum">[171]</span>"To you, sir, or to any other man who ventures to throw a doubt on
what Fairlegh has just stated," replied Oaklands, his brow flushing with
anger.
</p>
<p>
"Really," observed Wilford, with a contemptuous sneer, "Mr. Fairlegh
is most fortunate in possessing such a steady and useful friend: first,
when he dictates to Lawless what toasts he is to propose at his own
table, and threatens the company generally with the weight of his
displeasure should they venture to question the propriety of his so
doing, Mr. Oaklands kindly saves him from the consequences of this
warlike declaration, by advancing the somewhat novel doctrine, that his
friend, having spoken unadvisedly, ought not to act up to the tenor of
his words. Again, Mr. Fairlegh relates a marvellous tale of his earlier
days, and Mr. Oaklands is prepared to visit the most trifling indication
of disbelief with the fire and faggots of his indignation. Gentlemen,
I hope you are all good and true Fairleghites, or you will assuredly be
burned at the stake, to satisfy the bigotry of Pope Oaklands the First."
</p>
<p>
During this speech I could perceive by the veins on his forehead,
swollen almost to bursting, his firmly set teeth, and his Viands
clenched till the blood was forced back from the nails, that Oaklands
was striving to master his passion; apparently he succeeded in a great
measure, for, as Wilford concluded, he spoke calmly and deliberately:
"The only reply, sir," he began, "that I shall deign to make to your
elaborate insult is, that I consider it as such, and shall expect you to
render me the satisfaction due to a gentleman".
</p>
<p>
"No, Harry," exclaimed I, "I cannot permit this: the quarrel, if it be
a quarrel, is mine; on this point I cannot allow even you to interfere.
Mr. Wilford shall hear from me."
</p>
<p>
"No, no!" exclaimed Lawless; "I'm sure you must see, Wilford, that this
is not at all the sort of thing, eh? recollect Oaklands and Fairlegh
are two of my oldest friends, and something is due to me at all events,
eh?&mdash;Archer&mdash;Curtis&mdash;this cannot be allowed to go on."
</p>
<p>
By this time the party had with one accord risen from their seats, and
divided into groups, some collecting round Wilford and Lawless, others
about Oaklands and myself, and the confusion of tongues was perfectly
deafening. At length I heard Wilford's voice exclaim: "I consider it
unfair in the extreme to lay all this quarrelling and disturbance to
me, and, as it is not at all to my taste, I beg to wish you a very good
evening, Lawless".
</p>
<p>
<span class="pagenum">[172]</span>"You will do no such thing," cried Oaklands, and, bursting through
the cluster of men who surrounded him and endeavoured to detain him, he
sprang to the door, double-locked it, and, placing his back against it,
added, "no one loaves the room till this affair is settled one way or
other." The action, the tone of voice, and the manner which accompanied
them, reminded me so forcibly of a deed of a somewhat similar nature
at Dr. Mildman's, when Oaklands first heard of the loss of his letter
containing the cheque, and began to suspect foul play&mdash;that for a moment
the lapse of years was forgotten, and it seemed as though we were boys
together again.
</p>
<p>
Whenever Oaklands was excited by strong emotion of any kind, there was
a proud consciousness of power in his every look and motion, which
possessed for me an irresistible attraction: and now, as he stood, his
noble figure drawn up to its fullest height, his arms folded across his
ample chest in an attitude of defiance a sculptor would have rejoiced to
imitate; his head thrown slightly back, and his handsome features marked
by an expression of haughty indignation; when I reflected that it was
a generous regard for my honour which excited that indignation, I felt
that my affection for him was indeed "passing the love of women," and
that he was a friend for whom a man might resolve to lay down his life
willingly.
</p>
<p>
While these thoughts passed through my brain Lawless and several of the
more influential members of the party had been endeavouring to persuade
Wilford to own that he was in the wrong, and ought to apologise, but in
vain; the utmost concession they could get him to make was, that "he was
not aware that he had offered any particular insult to Mr. Oaklands, but
if that gentleman chose to put such a construction upon his words, he
could not help it, and should be ready to answer for them when and where
he pleased".
</p>
<p>
They were then, as a last resource, about to appeal to Oaklands, when I
interfered by saying "that the insult, if insult it was, had originated
from the part I had taken in the proceedings of the evening, and
was directed far more against me than Oaklands; that under these
circumstances it was impossible for me to allow him to involve himself
further in the affair. If my veracity were impugned, I was the proper
person to defend it; there could be but one opinion on that subject."
</p>
<p>
To this they all agreed, and at length Oaklands himself was forced
reluctantly to confess he supposed I was right.
</p>
<p>
"In this case, gentlemen," I continued, "my course is <span class="pagenum">[173]</span>clear; I
leave my honour in your hands, certain that in so doing I am taking the
wisest course; honourable men and men of spirit like yourselves will, I
feel certain, never recommend anything incompatible with the strictest
regard for my reputation as a gentleman; neither will you needlessly
hurry me into an act, the consequences of which might possibly embitter
the whole of my alter life. In order that personal feeling may not
interfere any more with the matter, my friend and I will withdraw;
Lawless will kindly convey to me your decision, on which, be it what it
may, I pledge myself to act;&mdash;-I wish you a very good-night."
</p>
<p>
Then telling Lawless I should sit up for him, and taking leave of two
or three members of the party with whom I was most intimate, I drew
Oaklands' arm within my own, and, unlocking the door, left the room,
Wilford's fierce black eyes glaring at us with a look of disappointed
fury, such as I have witnessed in a caged tiger, being the last object I
beheld.

<h2>
    CHAPTER XXII &mdash; TAMING A SHREW
</h2>
<pre>
          "I remember a mass of things, but nothing distinctly;
          A quarrel."

          "I do repent; but Heaven hath pleased it so
          To punish me with this."

          "We will compound this quarrel."

          "'What's that?'&mdash;'Why, a horse.'
          "'Tell thou the tale.'"

          "Nay, I will win my wager better yet,
          And show more signs of her obedience."

          "Now go thy ways, thou hast tamed a curst shrew."
          &mdash;<i>Shakspeare</i>.
</pre>
<p>
"WHY did you prevent me from giving that insolent scoundrel the lesson
he deserved?" was Oaklands' first observation as we left the quadrangle
in which Lawless's rooms were situated; "I do not thank you for it,
Frank."
</p>
<p>
"My dear Harry," replied I, "you are excited at present; when you are a
little more cool you will see that I could not have acted otherwise than
I did. Even supposing I could have borne such a thing myself, what would
have <span class="pagenum">[174]</span>been said of me if I had allowed you to fight in my quarrel?
no honourable man would have permitted me to associate with him
afterwards."
</p>
<p>
"But I don't see that the quarrel was yours at all," returned Oaklands;
"your share of it was ended when the toast affair came to a conclusion;
the rest of the matter was purely personal between him and myself."
</p>
<p>
"How can that be, when the origin of it was his doubting, or pretending
to doubt, the truth of the anecdote which I related?" inquired I. "No;
depend upon it, Harry, I have acted rightly, though I bitterly regret
now having gone to the party, and so exposed myself to all this. I have
always looked upon duelling with the greatest abhorrence; to run the
risk of committing murder (for I can call it by no milder name), when at
the very moment in which the crime is consummated you may fall yourself,
and thus even the forlorn hope of living to repent be cut off from you,
appears to me little short of madness. On one point I am resolved&mdash;if I
do go out with him, nothing shall induce me to fire at him; I will not
die a murderer, at all events."
</p>
<p>
"Should your life indeed be sacrificed," said Oaklands, and his deep
voice trembled with emotion as he spoke, "I will follow this man as the
avenger of blood, fix a mortal insult upon him wherever I meet him, and
shoot him like a dog, convinced that I shall perform a righteous act in
so doing, by ridding the world of such a monster!"
</p>
<p>
I saw by his manner that it would be useless to attempt to reason with
him at that moment&mdash;his warm feelings, and the fiery though generous
impulses of his impetuous nature, had so completely gained possession of
him, that he was no longer a reasonable creature&mdash;we therefore walked
in silence to my rooms, where we parted; I declining his offer to remain
with me till I should learn the decision of Lawless and his friends,
on the plea of wishing to be alone (which was, indeed, a true one),
although my chief reason for so doing was to prevent the possibility of
Oaklands saying anything in his present excited state of mind, which, if
repeated, might in any way involve him with Wilford.
</p>
<p>
My first act, when I found myself once more alone, was to sit down, and
endeavour calmly to review the situation in which I was placed. In the
event of their deciding that the affair might be arranged amicably, my
course was clear&mdash;I had only to avoid Wilford as much as possible during
the time I should remain at Cambridge, and, if <span class="pagenum">[174]</span>ever I were obliged
to be in his company, to treat him with a cool and studied civility,
which would leave him no pretext for forcing a quarrel upon me. On the
other hand, if they should think it imperative upon me to go out with
him, then indeed was the prospect a gloomy one. Wilford, whose ruthless
disposition was so well known as to have become, as it were, a by-word
among the set he mixed with, was not a man to be offended with impunity,
and as, moreover, I had made up my mind not to return his fire, the
chances were strongly against my escaping with life.
</p>
<p>
I am no coward; on the contrary, like most men whose physical energy is
unimpaired, I am constitutionally fearless, and in moments of danger
and excitement have never found myself wanting; still it would be
affectation to deny that the prospect of a sudden and violent death,
thus unexpectedly forced upon me, impressed my mind with a vague
sensation of terror, mingled with regret for the past, and sorrow for
the future. To be thus cut off in the bright spring-time of vigorous
manhood, when the warm blood of youth dances gladly through the veins,
and every pulse throbs with the instinct of high and noble daring&mdash;to
die with hopes unattained, wishes ungratified, duties unperformed&mdash;to
leave those we love without one parting look or word to struggle on
through this cold unsympathising world alone and unprotected&mdash;and, above
all, to lose one's life in an act the lawfulness of which was more than
questionable&mdash;all these things contributed to form a picture, which it
required either a very steadfast or an utterly callous heart to enable
one to gaze upon without blanching. I thought of the misery I should
entail upon my family; how, instead of fulfilling my father's dying
injunctions to take his place, and devote myself to comfort and protect
them, I should wound my mother's heart anew, and spread the dark mist
of sorrow over the fair prospect of my sister's young existence; and I
cursed my fastidious folly in objecting to the toast, to which, in my
self-accusation, I traced all that had afterwards occurred. Then, with
the inconsistency of human nature, I began to speculate upon what would
be Clara Saville's feelings, were she to learn that it was to prevent
the slightest breath of insult being coupled with her name that I was
about to peril, not only my life, but, for aught I knew, my hopes of
happiness here and hereafter. As the last awful possibility occurred
to me, the burden of my misery became too great for me to bear, and,
retiring to the privacy of my own chamber, I flung myself on my knees,
and poured <span class="pagenum">[176]</span>forth an earnest prayer for pardon for the past, and
deliverance for the future.
</p>
<p>
When I again returned to my sitting-room my mind had nearly recovered
its usual tone, and I felt prepared to meet and to go through whatever
might be before me with calmness and determination. As I was uncertain
how long it might be before Lawless would arrive, I resolved, in order
to avoid the horrors of suspense, to employ myself, and taking up the
mathematical treatise upon which I was engaged, and by a vigorous effort
of mind compelling my attention, I read steadily for about half an
hour, at the end of which time the sound of hasty footsteps was heard
ascending the stairs, and in another minute the door was flung open, and
Lawless and Archer entered the apartment.
</p>
<p>
"Reading mathematics, as I'm a slightly inebriated Christian!" exclaimed
Archer, taking the book out of my hands; "well, if that isn't pretty
cool for a man who may be going to be shot at six o'clock to-morrow
morning, for anything he knows to the contrary, I'm no judge of
temperature."
</p>
<p>
"Oh! bother mathematics," rejoined Lawless, flinging the book which
Archer held out to him at a bust of Homer adorning the top of my
bookshelves, which it fortunately missed&mdash;"Frank, old boy! it's all
right&mdash;you're not to have a bullet through your lungs this time&mdash;shake
hands, old fellow! I'm so glad about it that I've&mdash;"
</p>
<p>
"Drunk punch enough to floor any two men of ordinary capacity,"
interposed Archer.
</p>
<p>
"Of course I have," continued Lawless, "and I consider I've performed
a very meritorious act in so doing;&mdash;there was the punch, all the other
fellows were gone away, somebody must have drunk it, or that young
reprobate Shrimp would have got hold of it; and I promised the venerable
fish-fag his mother to take especial care of his what do ye call
'ums&mdash;morals, isn't it? and instil by precept, and&mdash;and&mdash;"
</p>
<p>
"Example," suggested Archer.
</p>
<p>
"Yes, all that sort of thing," continued Lawless, "a taste for, that is,
an unbounded admiration of, the sublime and beautiful, as exemplified
under the form of&mdash;"
</p>
<p>
"Rum punch, and lashings of it," chimed in Archer; "but suppose you were
to tell Fairlegh all that has passed since he came away, or let me do it
for you, whichever you like best."
</p>
<p>
"Oh! you tell him, by all means,&mdash;I like to encourage ingenuous youth;
fire away, Archer, my boy!"
</p>
<p>
<span class="pagenum">[177]</span>Thus urged, Archer informed me that upon my departure there had
been a somewhat stormy discussion, in which the events of the evening
were freely canvassed; and at last they came to a unanimous decision
that any man was at liberty to withdraw, if a toast was proposed to
which he objected, and that, if the toastmaster preferred giving it up
rather than allow him to leave the party, he had a perfect right to do
so. This being the case, they decided that Wilford, having been in the
wrong, ought to confess he had spoken hastily, and that, if he would do
so, and would add that he had meant nothing offensive either to me
or Oaklands, there the matter might rest. This for a long time he
positively refused to do; at length, finding he could get no one to
support him, he said that, as I had owned I was wrong in attempting to
prevent his expressing his opinion, he considered that, in all other
respects, I had behaved in a gentlemanly way; therefore, if he had said
anything which implied the contrary, he was willing to withdraw it. But,
in regard to Mr. Oaklands, he considered he had interfered in a very
uncalled-for manner; and he could only repeat, if that gentleman felt
himself aggrieved by anything he had said, the remedy was in his own
hands. As soon as he had spoken he withdrew.
</p>
<p>
The question was again debated, and at length they came to the
conclusion that what Wilford had said amounted to an ample apology as
far as I was concerned, which I was bound to accept; and that Oaklands,
having agreed to consider the quarrel mine, could not take any further
notice of it; therefore, the affair was at an end.
</p>
<p>
"Well," said I, as he finished his recital, "I must ever feel grateful
to you both for the trouble you have taken on my account, and the kind
feeling you have shown towards me throughout. I will not pretend to
deny that I am very glad the matter has been amicably arranged, for,
circumstanced as I am, with everything depending upon my own exertions,
a duel would have been ruin to me; but I must say I think the whole
business thoroughly unsatisfactory, and it is only my conviction that a
duel would make matters worse, instead of mending them, which leads me
to agree to the arrangement. I sincerely hope Oaklands will not hear
what Wilford said about him, for he is fearfully irritated against him
already."
</p>
<p>
"I'll tell you what it is," interrupted Lawless; "it's my belief that
Wilford's behaviour to you to-night was only assumed for the sake of
provoking Oaklands. <span class="pagenum">[178]</span>Master Stephen hates him as he does the very
devil himself, and would like nothing better than to pick a quarrel with
him, have him out, and, putting a brace of slugs into him, leave him&mdash;"
</p>
<p>
"Quivering on a daisy," said Archer, completing the sentence. "Really I
think," he continued, "what Lawless says is very true; you see Oaklands'
careless, nonchalant manner, which is always exactly the same whether
he is talking to a beggar or a lord, gives continual offence to Wilford,
who has contrived somehow to exact a sort of deference and respect from
all the men with whom he associates till he actually seems to consider
it his right. Then, Wilford's overbearing manner irritates Oaklands; and
so, whenever they have met, the breach has gone on widening, till now
they positively hate one another."
</p>
<p>
"How is it you are so intimate with him?" asked I; "for nobody seems
really to like him."
</p>
<p>
"Well, hang me if I can tell," replied Lawless; "but, you see he has
some good points about him, after all; for instance, I never saw him out
with the hounds yet that he didn't take a good place, aye, and keep it
too, however long the run and difficult the country. I killed the best
horse I had in my stables trying to follow him one day in Leicestershire
last season; my horse fell with me going over the last fence, and
never rose again. Wilford, and one of the whips, who was merely a
feather-weight, were the only men in at the death. I offered him three
hundred guineas for the horse he rode, but he only gave me one of his
pleasant looks, and said it wasn't for sale."
</p>
<p>
"You've seen that jet-black mare he rides now, haven't you, Fairlegh?"
asked Archer.
</p>
<p>
"Yes; what a magnificent creature it is!" was my reply.
</p>
<p>
"Did you ever hear how he came by it?"
</p>
<p>
On my answering in the negative, Archer continued: "Well, I wonder at
that, for it was in everybody's mouth at one time: it's worth hearing,
if it were but to show the determined character of the man. The mare
belonged to Lord Foxington, Lord Sellborough's eldest son. I believe
he gave five hundred guineas for her. She was a splendid animal,
high-couraged, but temperate. In fact, when you were on her she hadn't a
fault, but in the stable she was a perfect devil; there was only one man
who dared go near her, and he had been with her from the time she was
a filly: so that, when Foxington bought the mare <span class="pagenum">[179]</span>he was forced to
hire the groom too. The most difficult thing of all was putting on the
bridle; it was generally half an hour's work before she would let even
this groom do it. After dinner one day Foxington began talking about
this animal, saying what a brute she was to handle, and adding what I
have just told you, as to the impossibility of putting on the bridle,
when Wilford, who was present, made some remark, which showed he did not
believe in the impossibility. Upon which Foxington inquired whether he
doubted the fact he had just heard? Wilford replied that he was sure his
lordship fully believed in the truth of what he had just stated; but,
for his own part, he had so often found impossibilities of this nature
yield to a little courage and determination, that he confessed he was
somewhat sceptical. Now, it so happened that Foxington, soon after he
bought the mare, had thought just as Wilford did, and determined that
he would put the bridle on. Accordingly he attempted it, and the matter
ended by his getting regularly driven out ol the stable by the animal,
with a tolerably severe bite in the fleshy part of his shoulder.
Wilford's remark, therefore, as may be imagined, rather nettled him; and
he inquired, somewhat tartly, whether Wilford believed he could put the
bridle on? and, if so, whether he were willing to try? Wilford replied,
in his usual cool tone, that he had an idea he could do so, but that
he had no particular inclination to try, as it would probably be
some trouble, and the weather was too hot to render active exertion
desirable. At this Foxington laughed derisively, saying that it sounded
very like a put-off. 'Not at all,' returned Wilford; 'and to show
you that I never say a thing without being ready to act up to it, I am
willing to stake five hundred guineas against the mare herself that I
go up to her and put the bridle on without any assistance, and without
a stick or anything whatsoever in my hands.' Foxington accepted the bet
gladly, reckoning himself safe to pocket the five hundred guineas.
The affair was to come off the next morning at Foxington's stables,
at eleven o'clock. His lordship had invited all the men who had been
present when the bet was made to come and witness the event, expecting
a complete triumph over Wilford. While they were standing about waiting
Foxington told them of his own attempt, and his conviction, from the
experience he had then gained, that the thing could not be done; and
the general opinion was that Wilford, under the influence of wine,
had foolishly boasted of a thing which he would <span class="pagenum">[180]</span>not be able to
accomplish, and was certain to lose his money. As the time drew near,
and he did not make his appearance, an idea began to gain ground that he
meant to shirk the affair altogether; and Foxington was becoming
exceedingly irate, when, just as the clock was on the stroke of eleven,
the sound of a horse's feet was heard, and Wilford cantered quietly up,
looking as if he felt no personal interest whatever in the event. On his
arrival they proceeded at once to the stable in which the mare stood.
She was kept in a loose box, with her clothes on, but her head entirely
free.
</p>
<p>
"I ought, by-the-by," said Archer, interrupting himself, "to have told
you that I had the account from a man who was there at the time, and saw
the whole thing.
</p>
<p>
"Well, as soon as they went into the stable, the mare left off feeding,
and, turning round so as to face them, stood with her ears pricked up,
gazing wildly at them. Wilford just glanced at her, and then leisurely
divested himself of his coat, waistcoat, and neckcloth, turned up
the wristbands of his shirt, and, taking the bridle from the groom,
announced that he was ready. As soon as the door was open, Wilford fixed
his eyes sternly on the mare, and walked towards her. To the surprise
of every one the animal allowed him to approach quietly and pat her,
without showing any symptoms of vice. Men began to exchange inquiring
glances with each other, and those who had betted heavily against him
trembled for their money; but Foxington, who was better acquainted with
the animal, exclaimed, 'Wait a minute, he has not tried to touch her
head yet'. Wilford now moved his hand forward along the neck, patting
her, and speaking soothingly to her as he advanced; but, as he
approached the head, she became impatient and fidgety, and when he
attempted to take hold of the ear, in order to put on the bridle, she
flung up her head, reared, and ran back a few steps, where she stood,
shaking her mane and pawing the ground. After remaining in this position
a few seconds, she suddenly laid back her ears, and, showing the whites
of her eyes, ran at Wilford with her mouth wide open, and as soon as she
got within distance made a ferocious bite at him. By springing on one
side with great agility he just contrived to avoid it; then, dropping
the bridle, he threw himself into a sparring attitude (you know he's
a capital boxer), and, as the mare again ran at him, hit out, and,
striking her just on a particular spot by the ear, brought her down like
a bullock. As soon as she recovered her legs she renewed the attack, and
Wilford <span class="pagenum">[181]</span>received her as before, delivering his blow with the same
coolness and precision. When the animal rose the second time she seemed
partially stunned, and stood for a moment with her head hanging down and
her ears drooping; but on Wilford's making a step towards her she again
plunged forward, and attempted to seize him with her teeth. Once more
did Wilford evade her bite by springing on one side, and seizing his
opportunity succeeded in planting his hit, and, for the third time,
felled her to the ground. When she again rose, however, she showed no
disposition to renew the attack, but stood trembling violently, with the
perspiration running down her sides. She now allowed Wilford to approach
her, to stroke her head, pull her ears, and finally to put the bridle
on, and lead her out, completely conquered; and so my Lord Foxington
lost the best horse in his stables, and Wilford gained his bet, and
added to his character for invincibility, which, by the way, he cared
about much the most."
</p>
<p>
"It was a bold deed," returned I, as Archer concluded his story, "but
one does not like a man the better for having done it; there seems to me
a degree of wanton cruelty in punishing an animal so severely, unless he
had been actually forced to do it. Public executioners may be necessary
for the prevention of crime; but that is no reason why one need
volunteer as an amateur hangman."
</p>
<p>
"Everybody thought it an uncommonly plucky thing at the time, and there
was an immense fuss made with him afterwards," replied Archer.&mdash;"Why,
Lawless, are you asleep? rouse up, man&mdash;to bed&mdash;to bed. Good-night,
Fairlegh, you'll sleep all the better for knowing you are not to be shot
at cock-crow."
</p>
<p>
So saying, he took Lawless by the arm and marched him off, though, it
must be confessed, his gait, as he descended the stairs, was somewhat
unsteady.<span class="pagenum">[182]</span>

<h2>
    CHAPTER XXIII &mdash; WHAT HARRY AND I FOUND WHEN WE LOST OUR WAY
</h2>
<pre>
     "It is too true an evil&mdash;gone she is.

     Unhappy girl!    Ah! who would be a father!"

     "Far in the lane a lonely hut he found,
     No tenant ventured on th' unwholesome ground,
     Here smokes his forge: he bares his sinewy arm,
     And early strokes the sounding anvil warm;
     Around his shop the steely sparkles Hew,
     As for the steed he shaped the bending shoe."
     &mdash;<i>Gay's Trivia</i>.

     "'Be who thou wilt... thou art in no danger from me, so
     then tell me the meaning of this practice, and why thou drivest
     thy trade in this mysterious fashion&mdash;&mdash;'

     "'Your horse is shod, and your farrier paid&mdash;what need you
     cumber yourself further, than to mount and pursue your
     journey?'"

     &mdash;<i>Kenilworth</i>.
</pre>
<p>
ON the afternoon of the day after Lawless's wine-party Oaklands and I
were walking down to the stables where his horses were kept (he having,
in pursuance of his plan for preventing my over-reading myself, beguiled
me into a promise to ride with him), when we encountered Archer.
</p>
<p>
"I suppose you have heard the news <i>par excellence</i>," said he, after we
had shaken hands.
</p>
<p>
"No," replied I, "what may it happen to be?"
</p>
<p>
"Only that Lizzie Maurice, the pastry-cook's daughter, disappeared last
night, and old Maurice is going about like a distracted creature this
morning, and can't learn any tidings of her."
</p>
<p>
"What, that pretty girl with the long ringlets, who used to stand behind
the counter?" asked I. "What is supposed to have become of her?"
</p>
<p>
"Yes, that's the identical young lady," returned Archer. "All that seems
to be known about her is, that she waited till her father went out to
smoke his pipe, as he usually does for an hour or so every evening, and
then got the urchin who runs of errands to carry a bundle for her, and
set out without saying a word to any one. After she had proceeded a
little way, she was met by a man muffled up in a cloak, who took the
bundle from the boy, threw him a shilling, and told him to go home
directly. <span class="pagenum">[183]</span>Instead of doing so, however, he let them proceed for a
minute or two, and then followed them. They went at a quick pace along
one or two streets, and at length turned down a lane, not far from the
bottom of which a gig was waiting. Another man, also muffled up, was
seated in the gig, into which the girl was handed by her companion, who
said to the second man in a low tone, 'All has gone well, and without
attracting notice'. He then added in a warning voice&mdash;'Remember, honour
bright, no nonsense, or'&mdash;and here he sunk his voice so that the boy
could not catch what he said; but the other replied, 'On my word, on my
honour!'' They then shook hands; the second man gathered up the reins,
drew the whip across the horse, which sprang forward at speed, and they
were out of sight in a moment. The person who was left gazed after them
for a minute or so, and then, turning briskly on his heel, walked away
without perceiving the boy, who stood under the shadow of a doorway. On
being questioned as to what the men were like, he said that the first
kept his face entirely concealed, but he was rather tall, and had black
hair; the second was a stout man, with light hair and a high colour&mdash;for
a dark lantern which he had in the gig with him happened to throw its
light on his face as he was lighting it."
</p>
<p>
"At what time in the evening did all this take place?" inquired
Oaklands.
</p>
<p>
"Between nine and ten," replied Archer. Oaklands and I exchanged
glances; the same idea had evidently struck us both.
</p>
<p>
"Has any one seen Wilford this morning?" asked Oaklands.
</p>
<p>
"Seen him!" returned Archer; "yes, to be sure, he and Wentworth have
been parading about arm and arm all over the town: they were with me
when I met poor old Maurice, and asked him all sorts of questions about
the affair. Wilford seemed quite interested for him."
</p>
<p>
"Strange!" observed Oaklands musing. "I don't make it out. I would
not willingly wrong, even in thought, an innocent man. Archer," he
continued, "you have a shrewd keen wit and sound judgment; tell me in
confidence, man, who do you think has done this?"
</p>
<p>
"Nay, I am no diviner to guess other men's secrets," replied Archer;
"and these are subjects about which it is not over safe to hazard
conjectures. I have told you all I can learn about it, and it is for you
to draw your own conclusions, It is no use repeating things to you of
<span class="pagenum">[184]</span>which you are already aware; I might as well tell you dogs bark
and cats mew&mdash;that Wilford has black hair, and Wentworth is a stout man
with a high colour&mdash;or any other well-known truism. But I am detaining
you&mdash;good-morning." So saying, he shook hands with us and left us.
</p>
<p>
After walking some distance in silence Oaklands exclaimed abruptly: "It
must be so! it is Wilford who has done this thing&mdash;you think as I do, do
you not, Frank?"
</p>
<p>
"I am sure we have not evidence enough to prove it," replied I; "but I
confess I am inclined, as a mere matter of opinion, to agree with you,
though there are difficulties in the way for which it is not easy to
account. For instance, why should Wilford have gone to that party last
night and have incurred the risk of entrusting the execution of his
schemes to another, instead of remaining to carry them out himself?"
</p>
<p>
"That is true," said Oaklands thoughtfully, "I do not pretend to
understand it all clearly; but, somehow, I feel a conviction that
Wilford is at the bottom of it."
</p>
<p>
"You should recollect, Harry, that you greatly dislike this man&mdash;are,
as I conceive, prejudiced against him&mdash;and are therefore, of course,
disposed to judge him harshly."
</p>
<p>
"Yes I know all that; still you'll see it will come out, sooner or
later, that Wilford is the man. Her poor old father! I have often
observed how he appeared to doat upon that girl, and how proud he was
of her: his pride will be converted into mourning now. It is fearful
to think," continued Oaklands, "of what crimes men are guilty in their
reckless selfishness! Here is the fair promise of an innocent girl's
life blighted, and an old man's grey hairs brought down with sorrow
to the grave, in order to gratify the passing fancy of a heartless
libertine." He paused, and then continued, "I suppose one can do nothing
in the matter, having no stronger grounds than mere suspicion to go
upon?"
</p>
<p>
"I should say nothing likely to be of the slightest benefit," replied I.
</p>
<p>
"Then the sooner we get to horse the better," returned Oaklands;
"hearing of a thing of this kind always annoys me, and I feel disposed
to hate my species: a good gallop may shake me into a better humour."
</p>
<p>
"And the <i>dolce-far-niente</i>?" I inquired.
</p>
<p>
"Oh! don't imagine me inconsistent," was the reply. "Only somehow, just
at present, in fact ever since the <span class="pagenum">[185]</span>breeze last night, I've found
it more trouble to remain quiet than to exert myself; so, if you would
not tire me to death, walk a little faster, there's a good fellow."
</p>
<p>
After a brisk ride of nearly two hours along cross-roads, we came out
upon a wild heath or common of considerable extent.
</p>
<p>
"Here's a famous place for a gallop," exclaimed Oaklands; "I never can
make up my mind which is the fastest of these two horses; let's have a
race and try their speed. Do you see that tall poplar tree which seems
poking its top into the sky on the other side the common? that shall be
the winning-post. Now, are you ready?"
</p>
<p>
"All right, go ahead," replied I, bending forward and giving my horse
the rein. Away we went merrily, the high-couraged animals bounding
beneath us, and the fresh air whistling round our ears as we seemed to
cut our way through it. For some time we kept side by side. The horse
Oaklands rode was, if anything, a finer, certainly a more powerful
animal than the one on which I was mounted; but this advantage was fully
compensated by the fact of his riding nearly a stone heavier than I did.
We were, therefore, on the whole, very fairly matched.
</p>
<p>
After riding at speed, as well as I could reckon, about two miles,
Oaklands, to his great delight, had gained nearly a horse's length in
advance of me&mdash;a space which it seemed beyond my powers of jockeyship to
recover. Between us, however, and the tree he had fixed on as our goal
lay a small brook or water-course near the banks of which the ground
became soft and marshy. In crossing this the greater weight of man and
horse told against Oaklands, and gradually I began to creep up to him.
As we neared the brook it struck me that his horse appeared to labour
heavily through the stiff clay. Now or never, then, was my opportunity;
and shouting gaily, "Over first, for a sovereign&mdash;good-bye, Harry," I
gave my horse the spur, and, putting him well at it, cleared the brook
splendidly, and alighted safely on the farther bank.
</p>
<p>
Determined, if possible, not to be outdone, Harry selected a point, by
crossing at which he could contrive to cut off a corner, and thus gain
upon me considerably. In order to accomplish this it was necessary for
him to take his leap at a spot where the brook was some feet wider than
ordinary. Relying, however, on the known good qualities of the animal he
rode, he resolved to attempt it. Settling himself firmly in his saddle,
he got his horse well together, and then throwing up his whip-hand and
(as Lawless <span class="pagenum">[186]</span>would have termed it) "sticking in the persuaders," he
charged the brook at speed.
</p>
<p>
It was a well-imagined and bold attempt, and, had his horse been
fresher, would have succeeded in winning the race; but we had kept up
a fair pace during the whole of our ride, and now our gallop across the
common, and more particularly the severe pace over the marshy ground,
had tried his horse's wind considerably. Still, however, the noble
animal strove to the utmost of its power to answer the call made upon
it, and by a vigorous effort succeeded in clearing the brook; but
the ground on the other side was rugged and broken, and, apparently
exhausted by the exertion he had made, he stumbled, and after a slight
struggle to preserve his footing fell heavily forward, pitching Harry
over his head as he did so.
</p>
<p>
Fortunately the ground was soft and clayey, and neither man nor horse
seemed to have sustained any injury, for I had scarcely time to draw
rein ere they were on their legs again, and, as Harry's first act was to
spring lightly into the saddle, I determined to secure the race at once;
and cantering up to the poplar tree, which was now within a hundred
yards of me, I snapped off a bough in token of victory. As I turned back
again I observed that Harry had dismounted and was examining his horse's
foot.
</p>
<p>
"Nothing wrong, is there?" asked I, as I rejoined him.
</p>
<p>
"Yes, everything's wrong," was the reply; "you've been and gone and won
the race, you villain you&mdash;I've tumbled nose and knees into a mud-hole,
and spoiled my white cord oh-no-we-never-mention-ums&mdash;and 'the Cid' has
wrenched off one of his front shoes in the scrimmage."
</p>
<p>
"And that's the worst of all the misfortunes," said I, "for here we are
some ten or twelve miles from Cambridge at least, in a region utterly
unknown, and apparently devoid of inhabitants; so where we are to find a
smith passes my poor skill to discover."
</p>
<p>
"You're wrong about the inhabitants, I flatter myself," replied Harry.
"Do you see the faint white mist curling above those trees to the right?
I take that to be smoke; where there's smoke there must be fire; fire
must have been kindled by some human being or other&mdash;through that
individual we will endeavour to obtain an introduction to some
blacksmith, conjointly with sufficient topographical information to
enable us to reach our destination in time for a certain meal called
dinner, which has acquired an unusual degree of importance in my eyes
within the last hour or so. I have spoken!"
</p>
<p>
"Like a book," replied I; "and the next thing is to <span class="pagenum">[187]</span>bring your
sapient deductions to the test of experiment. There is a cart-track here
which appears to lead towards the smoke you observed; let us try that."
So saying, I also dismounted, and throwing my horse's bridle over my arm
we proceeded together on foot in the direction Oaklands had indicated.
</p>
<p>
Ten minutes' walking brought us into a rough country lane, winding
picturesquely between high banks and green hedges, affording an
agreeable contrast to the flat, unenclosed tracts of corn-land so
general throughout Cambridgeshire. After following this lane about a
quarter of a mile, we came upon a small, retired ale-house, surrounded
by trees. As we approached the door a stout, vulgar-looking woman,
dressed in rather tawdry finery, ran out to meet us; on coming nearer,
however, she stopped short as if surprised, and then re-entered the
house as quickly as she had left it, calling to some one within as she
did so. After waiting for a minute or two she came back, accompanied by
a tall, disagreeable-looking man in a velveteen shooting-jacket, with a
remarkably dirty face, and hands to match.
</p>
<p>
"Is there a blacksmith living anywhere near here, my good man?" inquired
Oaklands.
</p>
<p>
"Mayhap there is," was the reply in a surly tone. "Can you direct us how
to find him?" continued Oaklands.
</p>
<p>
"What might you want with him when you've found him?" was the rejoinder.
</p>
<p>
"My horse has cast a shoe, and I want one put on immediately,'" replied
Oaklands, who was getting impatient at the man's unsatisfactory, not to
say insolent, manner.
</p>
<p>
"Mayhap you won't get it done in quite such a hurry as you seems to
expect! There's a blacksmith lives at Stony End, about five miles
farther on. Go straight up the lane for about three miles, then turn
to the right, then twice to the left, and then you'll see a finger-post
that ain't got nothing on it&mdash;when you come to that&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>
<p>
"Which I never shall do, depend upon it," replied Oaklands. "My good
man, you don't imagine I'm going to fatigue myself and lame my horse by
walking five miles up this unlucky lane, do you? If things really are
as bad as you would make them out to be, I shall despatch a messenger
to summon the smith, and employ myself in the meanwhile in tasting your
ale, and consuming whatever you may happen to have in the house fit to
eat." I observed that the landlord and his wife, as I presumed
<span class="pagenum">[188]</span>her to be, exchanged very blank looks when Oaklands announced this
determination. When he ceased speaking she whispered a few words into
the ear of the man, who gave a kind of surly grunt in reply, and then,
turning to Harry, said, "Mayhap I'll shoe your horse for you myself if
you'll make it worth my while".
</p>
<p>
"<i>You</i> will? why, I thought you said there was not a smith within five
miles?"
</p>
<p>
"No more there ain't, only me."
</p>
<p>
"And you've been worrying me, and tiring my patience all this time,
merely to secure yourself a better bargain? Oh, the needless trouble
people give themselves in this world! Shoe the horse, man, and make your
own charge; be sure I'll not complain of it, only be quick," replied
Oaklands.
</p>
<p>
"P'r'aps that worn't all," returned the fellow gruffly; "but if ye be in
such a mighty hurry, bring 'un along here, and I'll clap a shoe on 'un
for ye in a twinkling."
</p>
<p>
So saying, he led the way through an old gate, and down a stable-yard
behind the public-house, at the bottom of which, under a kind of
half-barn, half-shed, was a blacksmith's shop, fitted up with a forge
and other appliances for shoeing. Our conductor (who having divested
himself of the velveteen jacket, which he replaced with a leather apron,
seemed now much more in his proper element) displayed greater quickness
and skill in making and applying the shoe, than from his previous
conduct I should have anticipated; and I began to flatter myself that
our difficulties were in a fair way to be overcome.
</p>
<p>
I was drawing up the girths of my horse's saddle, which had become
somewhat loosened from our gallop, when Oaklands, who had been sitting
on a gate near, industriously flogging his boot with his riding-whip,
jumped down, saying, "If you'll keep an eye to the horses, Prank, I'll
go and see if I can get some of the worst of this mud brushed off".
</p>
<p>
"Better stay where you are! I shall a done direc'ly," observed the
smith; "you ain't wanted at ther house, I tell yer."
</p>
<p>
"You should stick to your original trade, for your manners as an
innkeeper are certainly not calculated to fascinate customers, my
friend," replied Oaklands, walking towards the house.
</p>
<p>
The man muttered an oath as he looked after him, and then applied
himself to his work with redoubled energy. Above ten minutes had
elapsed, the shoe was made, <span class="pagenum">[189]</span>fitted to the hoof, and the process
of nailing on nearly concluded, but still Oaklands did not return. I was
tying my horse's rein up to a hook in the wall, with the intention of
seeking him, when I heard the noise of wheels in the lane, followed
immediately by the clatter of a horse's feet, ridden at speed&mdash;both
sounds at the moment ceased, as if the parties had stopped at the
inn-door. The blacksmith also heard them, and appeared for a moment
uncertain whether to continue his work or not; then, uttering an
impatient exclamation, he began twisting off and clenching the points
of the nails as though his life depended on his haste. Perceiving that
Oaklands' horse would be ready for him to mount directly, I turned to
unfasten my own, when the sound of men's voices raised high in angry
debate became audible; then a confused noise as of blows and scuffling
ensued, mingled with the screams of women; and immediately the
blacksmith's wife ran out, calling to her husband to hasten in, for that
"<i>they</i> had come back and quarrelled with the strange gentleman, and now
they were fighting, and there would be murder done in the house".
</p>
<p>
Without waiting to hear more I ran hastily up the yard, followed by
the blacksmith and the woman. On reaching the front of the house I
perceived, waiting at the door, a gig, in which was seated a man,
dressed in a suit of rusty black, while under the shade of the trees a
boy was loading up and down a magnificent black mare, which I instantly
recognised as the identical animal Wilford had become possessed of in
the manner Archer had related to me. The sounds of blows and struggling
still continued, and proceeded, as I now ascertained, from the parlour
of the ale-house. As the readiest method of reaching the scene of
action, I flung open the window, which was not far from the ground, and
without a moment's hesitation leaped into the room.

    CHAPTER XXIV &mdash; HOW OAKLANDS BROKE HIS HORSEWHIP

     whipping?"

     &mdash;Shakspeare.
</pre>
<p>
THE sight which met my eyes as I gazed around was one which time
can never efface from my memory. In the centre of the room, his brow
darkened by the flush of concentrated indignation, stood Oaklands, his
left hand clenching tightly the coat-collar of a man whom I at once
perceived to be Wilford, while with his right hand he was administering
such a horse-whipping as I hope never again to see a human being
subjected to. Wilford, who actually writhed with mingled pain and fury,
was making violent but ineffectual struggles to free himself. Near the
door stood Wentworth, the blood dropping from his nose, and his clothes
dusty and disordered, as if from a fall. Crouching in a corner at the
farther end of the room, the tears coursing down her fear-blanched
cheeks, and her hands clasped in an agony of terror and despair, was
a girl, about nineteen years of age, whom I had little difficulty in
recognising as Lizzie Maurice, the daughter of the old confectioner, of
whose elopement we had been that morning informed. On perceiving me
she sprang forward, and clasping my knees implored me to interfere and
endeavour to separate them. I was not, however, called upon to do so,
for, as she spoke, his riding-whip broke short in Oaklands' hand, and
dashing down the fragments with an exclamation of impatience, he flung
Wilford from him with so much force that he staggered forward a few
paces, and would have fallen had not Wentworth caught him in his arms,
just in time to prevent it.

<p>
<span class="pagenum">[191]</span>Oaklands then turned to the girl, whom I had raised from the
ground and placed on a chair, and addressing her in a stern impressive
manner, said: "I will now resume what I was saying to you when yonder
beaten hound dared to lay hands upon me. For the last time the choice is
offered to you&mdash;either return home, and endeavour, by devoting yourself
to your broken-hearted old father, to atone as best you may for the
misery you have caused him; or, by remaining here, commence a life of
infamy which will end sooner or later in a miserable death." He paused;
then, as she made no reply, but sat with her face buried in her hands,
sobbing as if her heart would break, he continued, "You tell me, the
vile tempter who has lured you from your duty promised to meet you here
to-day, and, bringing a clergyman with him, to marry you privately; now
if this is the truth&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>
<p>
"It is, it is," she faltered.
</p>
<p>
"If so," resumed Oaklands, "a knowledge of the real facts of the case
may yet save you. This scoundrel who has promised to marry you, and who
belongs to a rank immeasurably above your own, is already notorious for
what are termed, by such as himself, affairs of gallantry; while the
wretched impostor whom he has brought with him to act the part of
clergyman is the marker at a low billiard-table, and no more a clergyman
than I am."
</p>
<p>
"Is this really so?" exclaimed the girl, raising her eyes, which
were swollen and red with weeping, to Wilford's face; "would you have
deceived me thus, Stephen&mdash;you, whom I have trusted so implicitly?"
</p>
<p>
Wilford, who, since the severe discipline he had undergone, had remained
seated, with his head resting on his hand, as if in pain, apparently
unconscious of what was going on, glared at her ferociously with his
flashing eyes, but made no reply. The girl waited for a minute; but,
obtaining no answer, turned away with a half shudder, murmuring,
"Deceived, deceived!" Then addressing Oaklands, she said, "I will go
home to my father, sir; and if he will not forgive me, I can but lie
down and die at his feet&mdash;better so than live on, to trust, and be
deceived again".
</p>
<p>
"You have decided rightly, and will not repent it," remarked Oaklands
in a milder tone of voice; then, turning to the blacksmith (who had
made his appearance, accompanied by his wife, the moment the affray had
ended), he continued: "you must procure some conveyance immediately to
take this young person back to Cambridge, and your wife must accompany
her". <span class="pagenum">[192]</span>Observing that the man hesitated, and cast an inquiring
glance towards Wilford, he added sternly, "If you would not be compelled
to answer for the share you have taken in this rascally business before
the proper authorities, do as I have told you without loss of time".
</p>
<p>
The man having again failed in an attempt to attract Wilford's
attention, asked in a surly tone, "Whether a spring-cart would do?" and,
being answered in the affirmative, left the room.
</p>
<p>
Lizzie Maurice withdrew to prepare for her return home, the woman
accompanied her; Oaklands strode to the window, and remained watching
the operation of harnessing the horse to the tax-cart. Wilford still
retained the same attitude, and neither spoke nor moved. Wentworth
having glanced towards him once or twice, as if to divine his wishes,
receiving no sign, lit a cigar, and leaning His back against the
chimney-piece began to smoke furiously, whilst I devoted myself to
the pages of an old sporting magazine. Thus passed five minutes, which
seemed as if they would never come to an end, at the expiration of which
time the tax-cart, driven by a stout country lad, drew up to the door,
and the two women making their appearance at the same moment, Oaklands
turned to leave the room. As he did so Wilford, for the first time,
raised his head, thereby disclosing a countenance which, pale as death,
was characterised by an expression of such intense malignity as one
might conceive would be discernible in that of a corpse reanimated by
some evil spirit. After regarding Oaklands fixedly for a moment, he
said, in a low, grating tone of voice, "You have foiled me once and
again&mdash;when next we meet, it wilt, be my turn!" Oaklands merely smiled
contemptuously, and quitted the house.
</p>
<p>
Having mounted our horses, we ordered the lad who drove the spring-cart
to proceed at his fastest pace, while we followed at a sufficient
distance to keep it in sight, so as to guard against any attempt which
might be made by Wilford to repossess himself of his victim, without
positively identifying ourselves with the party it contained. We rode in
silence for the first two or three miles; at length I could refrain
no longer, and, half uttering my thoughts aloud, half addressing my
companion, I exclaimed, "Oh, Harry, Harry, what is all this that you
have done?"
</p>
<p>
"Done!" replied Oaklands, with a heightened colour and flashing eyes,
"rescued an innocent girl from a villain who would have betrayed her,
and punished the scoundrel <span class="pagenum">[193]</span>about half so severely as he deserved;
but that was my misfortune, not my fault. Had not the whip broken&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>
<p>
"You know that is not what I mean," returned I; "but this man will
challenge you, will&mdash;you are aware of his accursed skill&mdash;will murder
you. Oh! that fiendish look of his as you left the room&mdash;it will haunt
me to my dying day."
</p>
<p>
"And would you have had me leave the poor girl to her fate from a coward
fear of personal danger? You are strangely altered since you defied a
room full of men last night rather than allow Clara Saville's name to
be uttered by their profane lips; or, which is nearer the truth," he
continued with a kind smile, "your affection for me blinds you."
</p>
<p>
"Not so, Harry," replied I; "but it is the recollection of my own
feelings, when, while waiting for Lawless's report last night, I
believed I should be forced to meet this Wilford&mdash;it is the misery, the
self-reproach, the bitter penitence of that moment, when, for the first
time, I was able to reflect on the fearful situation in which by my own
rashness I had placed myself, a situation in which crime seemed
forced upon me, and it appeared impossible to act rightly&mdash;it is the
remembrance of all these things which causes me to lament that you,
my more than brother, should have involved yourself in similar
difficulties."
</p>
<p>
"But, Frank," he began&mdash;then, interrupting himself, he seized my hand,
and pressing it warmly between his own, exclaimed, "My dear old fellow,
forgive me if I have spoken unkindly to you; but this man has maddened
me, I believe". He paused, and then continued in a calmer voice, "Let me
tell you how it occurred, and you will see I could scarcely have acted
otherwise than I have done. You know I went into the public-house to
brush off the mud after my tumble. The instant my step sounded in the
passage, a girl tripped lightly down the stairs and ran towards me,
exclaiming joyfully, 'You have come at last, then!' On finding that it
was not the person she expected she stopped in alarm, and I perceived
to my astonishment that it was Lizzie Maurice. She recognised me at
the same moment, and apparently a new idea struck her, for she again
approached me, saying, 'Mr. Oaklands, tell me, sir, for heaven's sake,
has anything happened to Wilford?' Then, with woman's tact, perceiving
her mistake, she blushed deeply, adding in a timid voice, 'I fancied you
might have been riding with that gentleman; and seeing you alone, I was
afraid some accident might <span class="pagenum">[194]</span>have befallen your companion'. All this
convinced me that my suspicions had not been misplaced; and the thought
occurred to me that possibly it might not yet be too late to endeavour
to restore her to her father, while the recollection of Archer's account
of the old man's distress determined me to make the attempt.
</p>
<p>
"Taking her, therefore, by the hand, I led her into the parlour, and,
begging her to listen to me for five minutes, told her I was aware of
her elopement, and entreated her to return home again, adding that her
father was brokenhearted at her loss. She shed tears when I mentioned
the old man's grief, but positively refused to return home.
</p>
<p>
"Finding persuasion to be of no avail, I thought I would appeal to her
fears: so I informed her that I was aware of the name of the villain who
had enticed her away; that I would seek him out and expose him, and that
I should instantly acquaint her father with her place of refuge, and
advise him to come provided with proper powers to reclaim her. This
produced more effect, and, after some hesitation, she told me proudly
that I had done her foul wrong by my doubts; that Mr. Wilford meant
to make her his lawful wife; but that, in order to prevent his great
relations hearing of it till he could break it to them cautiously,
it was advisable to keep the affair quiet&mdash;(the old story, in short,
private marriage and all the rest of it)&mdash;a friend of Wilford's,
therefore, to avoid exciting suspicion, had kindly driven her over there
the night before, and she was now expecting her lover to come, and bring
a clergyman with him, who would marry them by licence on the spot; when
she heard my step she thought they had arrived. The air of truth with
which she told her tale carried conviction with it.
</p>
<p>
"I was about to represent to her the improbability of Wilford's
intentions being as honourable as she fondly imagined them, when a
gig drove up to the door, containing Wentworth and a fellow whom I
recognised as one of the billiard-markers in &mdash;&mdash; Street, dressed in
a seedy suit of black for the occasion; immediately afterwards Wilford
arrived on horseback. The whole thing was now perfectly clear. Wilford,
having made the girl believe he intended to marry her, persuaded
Wentworth, who is completely his tool, to carry her off for him; after
which he went to Lawless's wine-party, in order to show himself and
thereby avert suspicion. He then bribed the billiard-marker to play
parson, got Wentworth to bring him, and going out as if merely for a
ride had joined them here. I was considering what would be the best
<span class="pagenum">[195]</span>course to pursue, and was just coming out to consult you, when
the door was flung open, and Wilford and Wentworth entered hastily. The
moment Wilford's eyes fell upon me he started as if a serpent had stung
him, and his brow became black as night.
</p>
<p>
"Advancing a step or two towards me, he inquired, in a voice hoarse with
rage, what I was doing there. I replied, 'Endeavouring to prevent some
of his evil designs from succeeding'. He tried to answer me, but his
utterance was literally choked by passion; and turning away, he strode
up and down the room gnashing and grinding his teeth like a maniac.
Having in some degree recovered his self-control, he again approached
me, drew himself up to his full height, and, pointing to the door,
desired me to leave the room.
</p>
<p>
"I replied I should not do so until I had given the young lady a piece
of information respecting the character of one of the party&mdash;and I
pointed to the billiard-marker, who had not yet alighted&mdash;I should then,
I added, learn from her own lips whether she still wished to remain
there, or would take my advice and return to her father.
</p>
<p>
"Again Wilford ground his teeth with rage, and desired me, in a voice of
thunder, to 'leave the room instantly '; to which I replied flatly that
I would not.
</p>
<p>
"He then made a sign to Wentworth, and they both approached me, with the
intention of forcing me out. Fearing that their combined efforts might
overpower me (for Wentworth, though short, is a broad-shouldered, strong
man, and Wilford's muscles are like iron), I avoided their grasp by
stepping backwards, and, hitting out with my right hand as I did so,
caught Wentworth full on the nose, tapping his claret for him, as the
pugilists call it, and sending him down like a shot. At the same moment
Wilford sprang upon me with a bound like a tiger, and seizing me by
the throat a short but severe struggle took place between us. I was too
strong for him, however; and finding this, he would gladly have ceased
hostilities and quitted me, kindly postponing my annihilation till some
future day, when it could be more conveniently accomplished by means of
a pistol-bullet. But, as you may imagine, my blood was pretty well up
by this time, and I determined he should not get off quite so easily.
Seizing, therefore, my whip in one hand, I detained him without much
trouble with the other&mdash;his strength being thoroughly exhausted by his
previous exertions&mdash;and administered such a thrashing as will keep him
out of mischief for a week to come, at <span class="pagenum">[196]</span>all events. It was while
this was going on that you made your appearance, I think; so now you are
<i>au fait</i> to the whole affair&mdash;and pray, what else could I possibly have
done under the circumstances?"
</p>
<p>
"It is not easy to say," replied I. "I think the horse-whipping might
have been omitted, though I suppose the result would have been the same
at all events, and it certainly was a great temptation. The brightest
side of the business is your having saved the poor girl, who I really
believe is more to be pitied than blamed, having only followed the
dictates of her woman's nature, by allowing her feelings to overrule her
judgment."
</p>
<p>
"You have used exactly the right expression there," said Oaklands; "in
such cases as the present, it is not that the woman is weak enough to be
gulled by every plausible tale which may be told her, but that she has
such entire confidence, such pure and child-like faith in the man she
loves, that she will believe anything rather than admit the possibility
of his deceiving her."
</p>
<p>
"The deeper villain he, who can betray such simple trust," replied I.
</p>
<p>
"Villain, indeed!" returned Oaklands. "I would not have been in
Wilford's place, to have witnessed that girl's look when the conviction
of his baseness was forced upon her, for worlds; it was not a look of
anger nor of sorrow, but it seemed as if the blow had literally crushed
her heart within her&mdash;-as if the brightness of her young spirit had fled
for ever, and that to live would only be to prolong the duration of her
misery. No; I would rather have faced death in its most horrible form,
than have met that look, knowing that my own treachery had called it
forth."
</p>
<p>
We rode for some little distance in silence. At length I inquired how
he meant to arrange for Lizzie Maurice's return to her home, as it would
not do for us, unless he wished the part we had taken in the affair to
be known all over Cambridge, to escort her to her father's door in the
order of procession in which we were then advancing.
</p>
<p>
"No, I was just thinking of that," replied Oaklands. "It appears to me
that the quietest way of managing the affair will be to pay the boy
for the horse and cart at once, telling him to set Lizzie Maurice down
within a short distance of her father's shop, and then to drive back
with the woman. Lizzie can proceed on foot, and will probably at this
time of the evening (it was nearly seven o'clock) be able to enter the
house without attracting attention: we will, however, keep her in
sight, so as to be at hand to render her assistance should she require
<span class="pagenum">[197]</span>it. I do not myself feel the slightest doubt that her father will
believe her tale, and treat her kindly. I shall, however, leave her
my direction, and should she require my testimony in support of her
veracity, or should the old man be unwilling to receive her, she must
inform me of it, and I will call upon him, and try to bring him to
reason."
</p>
<p>
"That will not be necessary, depend upon it," returned I; "he will only
be too glad to recover her."
</p>
<p>
"So I think," replied Oaklands.
</p>
<p>
"What course shall you take with regard to Wilford?" inquired I.
</p>
<p>
"I shall never mention the affair to any one, if he does not," answered
Oaklands; "neither shall I take any step whatever in the matter. I am
perfectly satisfied, with the position in which I stand at present, and
if he should not enjoy an equal share of contentment, it is for him to
declare it&mdash;the next move must be his, and it will be time enough for me
to decide how to act when we see what it may be. I shall now tell Lizzie
Maurice of my plan for her, and inform her that as long as I hear she is
living quietly at home, and leading a respectable life, my lips will be
sealed with regard to the occurrences of to-day." So saying, he put his
horse into a canter, and riding up to the side of the cart, conversed
with the girl in a low tone of voice for several minutes; then, drawing
out his purse, handed some money to the driver, and rejoined me. "She
is extremely grateful to me for my promise of silence," he commenced;
"seems very penitent for her fault, and declares that this is a lesson
she shall never forget. She agrees to my plan of walking, and tells me
there is a side-door to the house, by which she can enter unobserved.
She promises to confess everything to her father, and hopes to obtain
his forgiveness; and appears altogether in 'a very proper frame of
mind,' as the good books say."
</p>
<p>
"Long may she remain so," returned I; "and now I am happy to say
there are some of the towers of Cambridge visible, for, like you, I am
becoming fearfully hungry."
</p>
<p>
"And for the first time during the last twenty-four hours I am actually
beginning to feel as tired as a dog," rejoined Harry, shrugging his
shoulders with an air of intense satisfaction.<span class="pagenum">[198]</span>

</pre>
<p>
OLD MAURICE, the pastry-cook, had welcomed his daughter gladly, as one
returned from the grave, and had learned from her own lips, with mingled
tears of joy and gratitude, how, thanks to noble Harry Oaklands, she had
escaped unscathed from the perils and temptations to which she had been
exposed; many days had elapsed, the Long Vacation had commenced, and the
ancient town of Cambridge, no longer animated by the countless throngs
of gownsmen, frowned in its unaccustomed solitude, like some City of the
Dead, and still no hostile message came from Wilford. Various reports
were circulated concerning the reappearance of Lizzie Maurice; but none
of them bore the faintest resemblance to the truth, and to no one had
the possibility of Oaklands' interference in the matter occurred, save,
as it afterwards appeared, to Charles Archer.
</p>
<p>
For above a week Wilford was confined to his room, seeing only
Wentworth; and it was given out that he had met with a severe fall from
his horse, and was ordered to keep perfectly quiet. At the expiration
of that period he quitted Cambridge suddenly, leaving no clue to his
whereabouts. This strange conduct scarcely excited any surprise amongst
the set he moved in, as it was usually his habit to shroud all his
proceedings under a veil of secrecy, assumed, as some imagined, for
the purpose of enhancing the mysterious and unaccountable influence he
delighted to exercise over the minds of men.
</p>
<p>
Oaklands remained a few days at Cambridge after Wilford's departure, as
he said, to pack up, but, as I felt certain, to prevent the possibility
of Wilford's imagining that he was anxious in any way to avoid him.
Finding at length that his rooms were dismantled, and that he would
not in all probability return till the end of the Long Vacation, Harry
ceased to trouble his head any further about the matter, and we set off
for Heathfield, accompanied by Archer, whom Harry had invited to pay him
a visit.
</p>
<p>
We found all well at our respective homes; my mother appeared much
stronger, and was actually growing quite stout, for her; and Fanny
looked so pretty, that I was not surprised at the very particular
attentions paid her from the first moment of his introduction by the
volatile Archer (who, by the way, was a regular male flirt), attentions
which I was pleased to perceive she appreciated exactly at their proper
value. We soon fell into our old habits again, Oaklands and Archer
setting out after breakfast for a stroll, or on a fishing expedition,
which usually ended in Harry's coming to an anchor under some spreading
oak or beech, where he remained, "doing a bit of the <i>dolce</i>," as Archer
called it, till luncheon time; whilst I, who could not afford to be
idle, read hard till about three o'clock, and then joined in whatever
amusement was the order of the day.
</p>
<p>
"Frank, may I come in?" exclaimed Fanny's silvery voice outside my study
door, one morning during my working hours when I had been at home about
a fortnight.
</p>
<p>
"To be sure you may, you little torment," replied I; "are you coming to
learn mathematics, or to teach me crochet? for I see you are armed with
that vicious little hook with which you delight to torture the wool of
innocent lambs into strange shapes, for the purpose of providing your
friends with innumerable small anomalous absurdities, which they had
much rather be without."
</p>
<p>
"No such thing, Mr. Impudence, I never make any article which is not
particularly useful as well as ornamental. But, Frank, dear," she
continued, "I should not have interrupted you, only I wanted to tell you
something&mdash;it may be nothing to signify, and yet I cannot help feeling
alarmed about it."
</p>
<p>
"What is it, darling?" said I, putting my arm round her taper little
waist, and drawing her towards me.
</p>
<p>
"Why, Mr. Oaklands has been here this morning; he came to bring mamma a
message from Sir John, inviting us all to dine with him to-morrow."
</p>
<p>
"Nothing very alarming so far," observed I; "go on."
</p>
<p>
"Mamma said we should be extremely happy to do so, and quitted the room
to find a recipe she had promised to the housekeeper at the Hall."
</p>
<p>
<span class="pagenum">[200]</span>"And you were left alone with Harry&mdash;that was alarming certainly,"
said I.
</p>
<p>
"Nonsense," returned Fanny, while a very becoming blush glowed on her
cheek; "how you do interrupt me! Mr. Oaklands had kindly offered to
explain a difficult passage in Dante for me, and I was standing on a
chair to get down the book&mdash;"
</p>
<p>
"Which he could have reached by merely stretching out his arm, I
daresay, only he was too idle," interposed I.
</p>
<p>
"Indeed he could not," replied Fanny quickly, "for he was sitting in
the low easy-chair, and trying to fasten mamma's spectacles on Donald's
nose." (Donald being a favourite Scotch terrier belonging to Harry, and
a great character in his way.) "Well, I had just found the book," she
continued, "and we were going to begin when a note was given to Mr.
Oaklands, which had been brought by a groom from the Hall, with a
message that the gentleman who had left it was waiting at the inn in the
village for an answer. Mr. Oaklands began to read it in his usual quiet
way, but no sooner had he thrown his eye over the first few lines
than his cheeks flushed, his brow grew dark, and his face assumed that
fearfully stern expression which I have heard you describe, but had
never before seen myself. As soon as he had finished reading it he
crushed the paper in his hand, and sprung up, saying hurriedly, 'Is
Frank&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;?' He then took two or three steps towards the door, and I
thought he was coming to consult you. Suddenly, however, some new idea
seemed to cross his mind, and, stopping abruptly, he strode towards
the window, where he remained for a few moments, apparently buried in
thought. At length he muttered, 'Yes, that will be better, better in
all respects'; and turning on his heel, he was about to quit the room,
leaving his hat on the table, when I ventured to hand it to him, saying,
'You are going without your hat, Mr. Oaklands'. He started at the sound
of my voice, and seeming for the first time to recollect that I was in
the room, he took the hat from me, begging pardon for his inattention,
and adding, 'You must allow me to postpone our Italian lesson
till&mdash;&mdash;till to-morrow, shall we say? I find there is a gentleman
waiting to see me.' He paused as if he wished to say more, but scarcely
knew how to express himself. 'You saw,' he continued, 'that is&mdash;you may
have observed that&mdash;that in fact there was something in that note which
annoyed me&mdash;you need not say anything about it to Mrs. Fairlegh; she
is rather given to alarming herself unnecessarily, I fancy,' he added
<span class="pagenum">[201]</span>with a faint smile; 'tell Frank I shall not be at home till dinner
time, but that I shall see him in the evening.' He then shook my hand
warmly, and, holding it for a moment in his own, fixed his eyes on my
face with a strange, half-melancholy expression that frightened me,
and once more saying 'good-bye,' he pressed his hat over his brows, and
bounding across the lawn, was out of sight in an instant. His manner
was so very odd, so unlike what it generally is. Dear Frank, what is
the meaning of all this? I am sure there is something going to happen,
something&mdash;"
</p>
<p>
"You silly child," replied I, affecting a careless composure I was
far from feeling, "how you frighten yourself about nothing. Harry has
probably received a threatening letter from a Cambridge dun, and your
lively imagination magnifies it into a&mdash;(challenge, I was going to add,
but I substituted)&mdash;into something dreadful."
</p>
<p>
"Is that what you really think?" questioned Fanny, fixing her large blue
eyes upon my face inquiringly.
</p>
<p>
I am the worst hand in the world at playing the hypocrite, and with
ready tact she perceived at once that I was attempting to deceive her.
</p>
<p>
"Frank," she resumed, "you have seen but little of me since we were
children together, and deem, possibly, that&mdash;I am a weak, silly girl,
unfit to be trusted with evil tidings; but indeed, dear brother, you
do me injustice; the sorrows we have gone through" (and her eyes filled
with tears as she spoke), "the necessity for exertion in order to save
mamma as much as possible, have given me more strength of character and
firmness of purpose than girls of my age in general possess; tell me the
truth, and fear not that power will be given me to bear it, be it what
it may; but, if I think you are trying to hide it from me&mdash;and do not
hope to deceive me; your face proves that you are as much alarmed
at what you have heard as I am myself, and probably with far better
reason&mdash;I shall be unable to forget it, and it will make me miserable."
</p>
<p>
"Well then," replied I, "thus far I will trust you. I do fear, from what
you have told me, that Oaklands has received some evil tidings relative
to a disagreeable affair in which he was engaged at Cambridge, the
results of which are not fully known at present, and which, I am afraid,
may yet occasion him much care and anxiety."
</p>
<p>
"And I had fancied him so light-hearted and happy," said Fanny
thoughtfully; "and is this all I am to know about it then?"
</p>
<p>
"All that I feel myself at liberty to tell at present," <span class="pagenum">[202]</span>replied I;
"recollect, darling, it is my friend's secret, not my own, or you should
hear everything."
</p>
<p>
"Then you will tell me all your secrets if I ask you?" inquired Fanny
archly.
</p>
<p>
"Whom should I trust or confide in, if not my own dear little sister?"
said I, stroking her golden locks caressingly. "And now," continued I,
rising, "I will go and see whether I can do any good in this affair; but
when Master Harry is in one of his impetuous moods he gets quite beyond
my management."
</p>
<p>
"Oh! but you can influence him," exclaimed Fanny, her bright eyes
sparkling with animation; "you can calm his impetuosity with your own
quiet good sense and clear judgment&mdash;you can appeal to his high and
generous nature&mdash;you can tell him how dear he is to you, how you love
him with more than a brother's love: you can and will do all this&mdash;will
you not, dear Frank?"
</p>
<p>
"Of course I shall do everything that I am able, my dear child," replied
I, somewhat astonished at this sudden outburst; "and now go, and be
quiet, this business seems rather to have excited you. If my mother asks
for me, tell her I am gone up to the Hall."
</p>
<p>
"What warm-hearted creatures women are!" thought I, as I ran, rather
than walked, through the park; "that little sister of mine, now&mdash;no
sooner does she hear that <i>my</i> friend has got into a scrape, of the very
nature of which she is ignorant (a pretty fuss she would be in if she
were aware that it was a duel, of which I am afraid), than she becomes
quite excited, and implores me, as if she were pleading for her life, to
use my influence with Harry to prevent his doing&mdash;something, she has not
the most remote notion what. I wish she did not act quite so much from
impulse. It's lucky she has got a brother to take care of her; though it
does not become me to find fault with her, for it all proceeds from her
affection for me; she knows how wretched I should be if anything were
to go wrong with Harry,"&mdash;and then I fell into a train of thought as to
what it could be which had so suddenly excited him: something connected
with Wilford, no doubt; but what?&mdash;my fears pointed to a challenge,
and my blood ran cold at the thought. He <i>must</i> accept it; neither my
influence, were it increased a hundredfold, nor that of any one else,
could make him apologise; besides, it is not very easy to imagine a
satisfactory apology for horse-whipping a man till he cannot stand. And
what course likely to be of any use could I take? On one point I was
resolved&mdash;nothing <span class="pagenum">[203]</span>should induce me to become his second. What
would be my feelings in case of a fatal result were I to reflect that I
had made all the arrangements for the murder of the friend I loved
best in the world&mdash;that I had actually stationed him opposite the
never-failing pistol of his most bitter enemy, and placed in his hand a
deadly weapon wherewith to attempt the life of a fellow-creature, when
the next moment he might be called upon to answer before the Judge of
all mankind for the deeds which he had done in the flesh? No! I could
not be his second. As my meditations reached this point, I overtook
the groom who had brought the eventful note, and who was leisurely
proceeding on foot towards the Hall with that peculiar gait observable
in men who spend much of their time on horseback, which consists of a
compromise between walking and riding, and is strongly suggestive of
their inability to realise the fact that they have not at all times and
seasons a perpetual horse between their legs.
</p>
<p>
"Have you seen Mr. Oaklands, Harris?" inquired I, as the man touched his
hat respectfully.
</p>
<p>
"Yes, sir, I may say I've seen him, and that's all," was the reply. "I
brought him a note to the cottage, and was a waiting for orders, when
he came tearing out, ordered me to get off, sprang into my saddle, and
without stopping for me to let down the stirrups, drove his heels into
'Tom Trot'&mdash;that's the new grey horse, sir, if you please&mdash;and was out
of sight like old boots."
</p>
<p>
Not having time to institute an inquiry into the amount of velocity with
which the ancient articles referred to by Mr. Harris were accustomed to
vanish, I asked if he knew who brought the note.
</p>
<p>
"A groom in a dark, claret-coloured livery, mounted on a splendid
coal-black mare, nearly thorough-bred, but with more bone and substance
about her than you generally see in them sort, and as clean on her pins
as an unbroke colt. Sir John ain't got such a horse in his stables, nor
Mr. Harry neither," was the reply.
</p>
<p>
This was conclusive evidence; the livery and the mare were alike
Wilford's.
</p>
<p>
Leaving the groom to conjecture what he pleased, I hurried on, and,
reaching the Hall, inquired of the old butler whether Harry was at home.
</p>
<p>
"No, sir," was the reply, "they ain't any of them at home. Mr. Harry
came home a horseback about a quarter of an hour ago, and called Mr.
Archer into his own room, and they had a confab, and then Mr. Archer
went out a <span class="pagenum">[204]</span>riding on the same horse Mr. Harry came back upon, and
would not take any o' the grooms with him&mdash;and afore that Sir John had
ordered the phaeton, and Mr. Henry being come home he asked him to go
with him; so you see, Mr. Fairlegh, they're none of 'em at home, sir."
</p>
<p>
"I'll go into the library and write a note, Edmonds," said I, as a new
idea entered my head. "You know Sir John is kind enough to let me order
a horse whenever I require one&mdash;will you tell Harris to have one saddled
for me in ten minutes' time?"
</p>
<p>
"Certainly, Mr. Fairlegh; we all of us have Sir John's orders to attend
to you, sir, the same as to Mr. Henry, and you're a young gent as it's a
pleasure to serve too, if you'll excuse me taking the liberty of telling
you so," replied the good old man, as he showed me into the library.
</p>
<p>
The idea which had come into my head (and it was more for the sake of
doing <i>something</i> that I determined on it, than from any great hope
I entertained of its proving of much avail) was to ride over to
Hillingford, and consult Freddy Coleman on the subject. Perhaps his
clear head and quick wit might enable him to devise some scheme by
which, without betraying Harry's confidence, or bringing the slightest
imputation on his honour, this duel might be prevented. What else could
I do? It was quite clear to me that the note Harry had received was a
challenge from Wilford, and that the gentleman waiting at the inn was
some one whom he had prevailed upon to act as his second, probably
Wentworth. Harry's first impulse had evidently been to come to me, and
ask me to be his second; but, doubtless, guessing the distaste I should
have to the office, and reflecting on the difficulties in which, if
anything serious were to ensue, I might be involved, he had determined
on asking Archer instead. Archer, by instantly setting off on horseback
alone, had clearly agreed to his request, and was gone to make the
necessary arrangements; and Harry had gladly accompanied Sir John, in
order to be out of the way, and so avoid my questions and any attempts I
might have made to induce him to alter his purpose. Were I to inform
Sir John on his return, it would be an unpardonable breach of confidence
towards Harry; were I to give notice to the authorities, so as to enable
them to take measures for preventing the duel, it would always be said
by Wilford that I did so with Harry's connivance, because he was afraid
to meet him: thus my hands were tied in every way, and, as I said
before, I could think of nothing better than to ride over and consult
Coleman, whose powers of <span class="pagenum">[205]</span>getting out of a scrape I had seen pretty
well tested in the affair of the bell-ringing. I therefore scrawled a
hasty note to my mother, telling her that I was going to take a long
ride, and she had better not wait dinner for me; and leaving a message
for Oaklands with the servant who announced the horse, that I should see
him in the evening, flung myself into the saddle, rode quietly till
I was out of sight of the house, and then started at a gallop for
Hillingford. Unwilling to meet any of the Coleman family, I left my
horse at the inn, and, pulling my hat over my brows, to avoid, if
possible, being recognised by their servant, rang the bell, and desired
him to tell Mr. Frederic that a gentleman wanted to speak with him on
particular business.

    CHAPTER XXVI &mdash; COMING EVENTS CAST THEIR SHADOWS BEFORE
</h2>
<pre>
     "If you think your mystery in stratagem can bring this instru-
     ment of honour again into his native quarter, be magnanimous
     in the enterprise, and go on; I will grace the attempt for a
     worthy exploit if you speed well in it."

     "Now I see the bottom of your purpose."

     "You see it lawful then."

     "I love him, sir,
     Dearer than eyesight, space and liberty,
     Beyond what can be valued rich or rare,
     No less than life, with grace, health, beauty, honour;
     A love that makes breath poor, and speech unable&mdash;"

     "Adieu! these foolish drops do somewhat drown my manly
     spirit."
     &mdash;<i>Shakspeare</i>.
</pre>
<p>
"FREDDY, can I have half an hour's private conversation with you?" asked
I, as soon as we had exchanged salutations.
</p>
<p>
"To be sure you can; but," he added, catching a glimpse of the anxious
expression of my face, "there is nothing wrong, is there?"
</p>
<p>
I made a gesture indicative of silence, and he opened a door into a sort
of lawyer's office, saying, in a low voice:&mdash;
</p>
<p>
"Come in here, we shall not be interrupted; the governor's in London,
and the women are out walking". "So much the better," replied I, "for
the business I am come upon is strictly private, and will not brook
delay." I then told him as concisely as possible the whole affair
<span class="pagenum">[206]</span>from beginning to end; he listened attentively to my recital,
merely asking a question now and then to elucidate any particular point
he did not clearly understand. I fancy he made a gesture of surprise
when I first mentioned Wilford's name, and when I had concluded, he
asked,
</p>
<p>
"Wilford, you say, this man's name is? What is his Christian name?"
</p>
<p>
"Stephen."
</p>
<p>
"And he's a young fellow?"
</p>
<p>
"About three or four and twenty."
</p>
<p>
"And you want to prevent his being able to shoot Harry Oaklands at five
o'clock to-morrow morning?"
</p>
<p>
"I do not know the hour, but I conclude the meeting will probably
take place to-morrow morning. Wilford would not wish to remain in the
neighbourhood longer than necessary, lest he should attract attention."
</p>
<p>
Coleman mused for some minutes, and then muttering as though he were
thinking aloud&mdash;
</p>
<p>
"It might be done, so; yes, that would do. I suppose," he said, at
length addressing me, "if Master Wilford were taken into custody on a
magistrate's warrant at half-past four a.m., that would suit your ideas
very nicely? I can so arrange the matter that Wilford will never be able
to trace the laying the information to our door."
</p>
<p>
"But how can you avoid that?" inquired I.
</p>
<p>
"Why, if you must know," replied Freddy, "I am acquainted with a man
who would give a hundred pounds any day to stop our friend Stephen from
fighting a duel."
</p>
<p>
"What, do you know Wilford then?" asked I.
</p>
<p>
"<i>Ray-ther</i>," was the reply, accompanied by a very significant
wink&mdash;"just a <i>very few</i>&mdash;I should say we're not entire strangers,
though I have never enjoyed the honour of much personal intercourse with
him; but I do not so deeply regret that, as, from your account, it seems
rather a dangerous privilege."
</p>
<p>
"How in the world do you know anything about him?"
</p>
<p>
"Oh! it's a long story, but the chief points of it are these:
The aforesaid Mr. Wilford, if he can continue to exist till he is
five-and-twenty, comes into five thousand pounds a year; but if we don't
interfere, and Harry Oaklands has the luck to send a bullet into him
to-morrow morning, away it all goes to the next heir. Wilford is now
three-and-twenty, and the trustees make him a liberal allowance of eight
hundred pounds per annum, on the strength of which he spends between two
thousand pounds and three thousand pounds: of course, in order <span class="pagenum">[207]</span>to
do this, he has to raise money on his expectancies. About two months
ago he wanted to sell the contingent reversion of a large estate in
Yorkshire, from which the greater part of his future income is to be
derived; and a client of ours thought of buying it&mdash;ergo, we were set to
work upon the matter: whilst we were investigating his right, title, and
all that sort of thing, lo and behold! a heavy claim, amounting to some
thousands, is made upon the property&mdash;by whom, do you think, of all
people in the world?&mdash;none other than our old acquaintance, Richard
Cumberland!"
</p>
<p>
"Good heavens!" exclaimed I, "how strange!"
</p>
<p>
"Cumberland," continued Freddy, "has become somehow connected with a
lot of bill-brokers,&mdash;low stock-jobbers,&mdash;in fact, a very shady set of
people, with whom, however, in our profession, we cannot avoid being
sometimes brought into contact; he appears, indeed, himself to be a sort
of cross between black-leg and money-lender, improved by a considerable
dash of the gambler, and presenting altogether a very choice specimen of
the thorough and complete blackguard. Somehow or other he contrives to
have cash at command, and, instead of being pigeoned, has now taken to
pigeoning others; and, to give the devil his due, I fancy he does a very
pretty stroke of business in that line. He is a good deal improved in
manner and appearance since you remember him; and among people who don't
know him very intimately, he affects the man about town: in short, he is
quite at the top of his profession. Wilford became acquainted with him
at one of the Newmarket meetings, lost money to him, and borrowed money
of him, giving him as security a contingent charge upon the estate of
double the amount&mdash;ergo, don't you see, if Wilford should by any chance
get his quietus from Harry's pistol, he won't live to come into his
property, in which case Master Dicky Cumberland is minus some thousands.
Now, if I contrive to give him a hint, depend upon it he stops the duel.
I will caution him not to let my name appear&mdash;he will not hear yours; so
in this way I think we may manage the affair, and defy the old gentleman
himself, though he's a very cunning lawyer, to trace it to us."
</p>
<p>
"Well," said I, "as I see no other means of saving Oaklands' life&mdash;for
this Wilford is a noted duellist, and no doubt thirsts to wash out the
insult he has received in blood&mdash;I suppose we must do it; but it is an
underhand proceeding which I do not at all like."
</p>
<p>
"There you go with your chivalric, high-flown, romantic <span class="pagenum">[208]</span>notions,
you would stand coolly by, and see the best friend you have in the world
butchered before your eyes, rather than avail yourself of a splendid
chance of saving him, which Fortune has thrown in your way, because,
forsooth, it involves a little innocent manoeuvring!&mdash;for heaven's sake,
my dear boy, get off your stilts, and give common sense fair play."
</p>
<p>
"I can only repeat what I have just said," replied I; "I will do it,
because I believe it is the only thing to save Harry; but I do not like
it, and never shall."
</p>
<p>
"I cry you mercy, Signor Francisco dc Fairlegh, the veritable Don
Quixote of the nineteenth century," laughed Freddy; "and now, most
chivalrous sir, where do you imagine it probable that this evil
<i>faiteur</i>, this man of powder and pistols, hangs out?"
</p>
<p>
"He is most likely at the inn at Carsley, a village on the London road,
about four miles from us," replied I; "I don't know of any other place
in the neighbourhood where he could be lodged. But I'll tell you what
I'll do&mdash;the name of the inn is the White Horse&mdash;if I should prove
wrong in fancying he is there, I will send a message to that inn to say
where he may be found."
</p>
<p>
"Exactly," returned Freddy, entering the White Horse, Carsley, in his
tablets; "now I think I know all about it, and it shall not be my fault
if this duel comes off to-morrow morning. Good-bye, old fellow! I wish
you did not look quite so grumpy about it, but it's all those mediæval
prejudices of yours. I daresay you'd think it a much more manly way of
stopping the business to electrotype yourself in brass and steel, throw
yourself across a cart-horse plated to match, and shouting, 'Fairlegh
to the rescue!' run a long pole, pointed with iron, through Wilford's
jugular. Now, I consider mine much the most philosophical way of doing
the trick; in fact, conducting a dodge of this kind always affords me
intense satisfaction, and puts me into the highest possible
spirits. Have you ever seen the war dance, in which the
Hotto-potto-cum-from-the-wash-ki Indians usually indulge before they set
out on an expedition?&mdash;A quarter to three," he continued, pulling out
his watch, "the coach to London passes in five minutes, I shan't have
time to show it you&mdash;it begins so." Thus saying, he flung himself into a
perfectly indescribable attitude, and commenced a series of evolutions,
more nearly resembling the contortions of a dancing bear, than any other
Terpsichorean exhibition with which I was acquainted. Having continued
this until he had made himself very <span class="pagenum">[209]</span>unnecessarily hot, he wound
up the performance by flinging a summerset, in doing which he overturned
himself and the coal-scuttle into a box of deeds; whereby becoming
embarrassed, he experienced much difficulty in getting right end
upwards again. "There," he exclaimed, throwing himself into an
arm-chair commonly occupied by his father's portly form&mdash;"There! talk of
accomplishments&mdash;show me a fashionable young lady who can do that,
and I'll say she <i>is</i> accomplished. It's rather warm work, though," he
continued, wiping his brow, "unless one wears the appropriate costume,
which, I believe, consists of a judicious mixture of red and yellow
paint, three feathers, and the scalp of your opposite neighbour.
Pleasant that," he added, pointing to the reversed coal-scuttle&mdash;"that's
a new addition, not of 'Coke upon Littleton,' but of Coal upon&mdash;what's
the suit? aye, Buffer <i>versus</i> Stoker. I shall have to make out a case
of circumstantial evidence against the cat, or I'm safe for a rowing
from the governor. Good-bye, old boy! don't fancy I'm mad; I'm not
the fool I seem, though I confess appearances are against me just at
present. There's the coach, by Jingo, three bays and a grey&mdash;no chance
of the box&mdash;is this a hat? off we go." So saying, he shook my hand
warmly, bounded down the steps, and the next moment was rattling away
towards London as fast as four horses could hurry him.
</p>
<p>
It was with a heavy heart, and a foreboding of coming evil, that
I mounted my horse, and slowly retraced my way towards Heathfield.
Coleman's exuberant spirits, which, I believe, were partly assumed with
a view to cheer me by diverting my attention from the painful subject
which engrossed it, had produced an effect diametrically opposite to
that which he had intended, and I felt dissatisfied with the step I
had taken, doubtful of the success of his mission, anxious to a degree,
which was absolutely painful, about the fate of Harry, and altogether
thoroughly miserable. I reached home in time for dinner, during which
meal my abstracted manner and low spirits were so apparent as to set my
mother speculating on the chances of my having over-heated myself and
"got a chill," whilst Fanny's anxious questioning glances, to which I
was well aware I could furnish no satisfactory reply, produced in me a
degree of nervous excitement which was unbearable, and, the moment the
cloth was withdrawn, I left the room and rambled forth into the wildest
parts of the park. The quiet peaceful beauty of the scene, and the
refreshing coolness of the <span class="pagenum">[210]</span>evening air, had, in a great measure,
calmed the excitement under which I laboured, and I was turning my steps
towards the Hall when I met Oaklands and Archer, who, finding I was not
at the cottage, had come in search of me. Half an hour's conversation
served to render all my previous conjectures matters of certainty. The
challenge had been given and accepted, Wentworth was to be Wilford's
second, and he and his principal were staying at the inn at Carsley.
</p>
<p>
The spot chosen for the scene of action was a plot of grass-land
situated about half-way between Carsley and Heathfield, so as to be
equally accessible to both parties; the time appointed was five o'clock
the following morning. Archer was to act as Oaklands' second; everything
had been managed with the greatest caution, and they did not believe a
single creature, excepting themselves, had the slightest suspicion that
such an event was likely to take place. They had resolved not to tell me
till everything was settled, as they feared my opposition. Having thus
taken me into their confidence, Archer left us, saying, that "probably
Oaklands might like to have some private conversation with me, and he
would join us again in half an hour". Rejoiced at this opportunity,
I entered at once upon the subject which most interested me, and used
every argument I could think of to induce Harry not to return Wilford's
fire.
</p>
<p>
Oaklands heard me for some time in silence, and I began to fear my
efforts would be fruitless, when suddenly he turned towards me, and
said&mdash;his fine eyes beaming with an almost womanly expression of
tenderness as he spoke&mdash;"Would this thing make you happier in case I
fall?" A silent pressure of the hand was my only answer, and he added in
a low voice, "then it shall be as you wish". A pause ensued for my
own part, the thought that this might be our last meeting completely
overpowered me; I did not know till that moment the strength and
intensity of my affection for him. The silence was at length interrupted
by Oaklands himself, and the low tones of his deep rich voice trembled
with emotion, as they fell mournfully on the stillness of the evening
air. "My father!" he said, "that kind old man, whose happiness is
wrapped up in my welfare&mdash;it will break his heart, for he has only me to
love. Frank, my brother!" he added, passing his arm round my neck, as he
had used to do when we were boys together, "you are young; your mind is
strong and vigorous, and will enable you to meet sorrow as a man should
confront and overcome whatever is <span class="pagenum">[211]</span>opposed to him in his path
through life. I will not disguise from you that, looking rationally
and calmly at the matter, I have but little hope of quitting the
field to-morrow alive. My antagonist, naturally a man of vindictive
disposition, is incensed against me beyond all power of forgiveness, and
his skill is fully equal to his malice: should I fall, I leave my father
to your care; be a son to him in the place of the one he will have lost.
This is not a light thing which I ask of you, Frank! I ask you to give
up your independence, your high hopes of gaining name and fortune by
the exercise of your own talents and industry, and to devote some of
the best years of your life to the weary task of complying with the
caprices, and bearing the sorrows, of a grief-stricken old man. Will you
do this for me, Frank?"
</p>
<p>
"I will," replied I; "and may God help me, as I execute this trust
faithfully!"
</p>
<p>
"You have relieved my mind of half its burden," returned Oaklands
warmly. "I have only one thing more to mention&mdash;When I came of age last
year my father's liberality made over to me an ample income for a single
man to live on: excepting a few legacies to old servants, I have divided
this between your good little sister and yourself, which I thought you
would prefer to my leaving it to you alone."
</p>
<p>
"Harry I indeed, I cannot allow you to do this; others must surely have
claims upon you."
</p>
<p>
"There is not a being in the world who has a right to expect a farthing
at my death," answered he; "the next heir to the entailed estates is a
distant relation in Scotland, already wealthy. My father has always been
a careful man, and, should he lose me, will have a larger income than he
can possibly be able to spend; besides, as the duties I have led you
to undertake must necessarily prevent you from engaging actively in any
profession, I am bound in common fairness to provide for you."
</p>
<p>
"Be it so, then," replied I&mdash;inwardly breathing a prayer that I never
might possess a sixpence of the promised fortune.
</p>
<p>
"One thing more," added Harry. "When you return to Trinity&mdash;poor old
Trinity, shall I ever visit you again!&mdash;find out how Lizzie Maurice is
going on, and if she should marry respectably in her own rank, ask my
father to give you a hundred pounds as a wedding present for her; only
hint that it was my wish, and he would give twenty times the sum. And
now good&mdash;pshaw!" he continued, drawing his hand across his eyes, "I
shall <span class="pagenum">[212]</span>play the woman if I talk to you much more&mdash;good-night,
Frank&mdash;do you accompany us to the ground to-morrow morning?"
</p>
<p>
"I will go with you," returned I, with difficulty overcoming a choking
sensation in my throat; "I may be able to be of some use."
</p>
<p>
"Here comes Archer," said Oaklands, "so once more good-night; I must get
home, or my father will wonder what is become of me."
</p>
<p>
My heart was too full to speak, and pressing his hand I turned abruptly
away, and walked quickly in the opposite direction.

<p>
I DID not return to the cottage until the usual hour for going to bed,
as I did not dare subject myself to Fanny's penetrating glance in my
present state of excitement. The moment family prayers were concluded I
took my candle, and, pleading fatigue, retired to my room. Knowing
that sleep was out of the question in my then frame of mind, I merely
substituted the clothes I intended to wear in the morning for those I
had on, and, wrapping my dressing-gown round me, flung myself on the
bed. Here I lay, tossing about, and unable to compose myself for an hour
or two, the one idea constantly recurring to me, "What if Coleman should
fail!" At length, feverish and excited, I sprang up, and throwing open
the window which was near the ground, enjoyed the fresh breeze as it
played around my heated temples. It was a lovely night; the stars, those
calm eyes of heaven, gazed down in their brightness on this world
of <span class="pagenum">[213]</span>sin and sorrow, seeming to reproach the stormy passions and
restless strife of men by contrast with their own impassive grandeur.
After remaining motionless for several minutes, I was about to close the
window when the sound of a footstep on the turf beneath caught my ear,
and a form, which I recognised in the moonlight as that of Archer,
approached.
</p>
<p>
"Up and dressed already, Fairlegh?" he commenced in a low tone as he
perceived me; "may I come in?"
</p>
<p>
In silence I held out my hand to him, and assisted him to enter.
</p>
<p>
"Like me," he resumed, "I suppose, you could not sleep."
</p>
<p>
"Utterly impossible," replied I; "but what brings you here&mdash;has anything
occurred?"
</p>
<p>
"Nothing," returned Archer; "Oaklands retired early, as he said he
wished to be alone, and I followed his example, but could not contrive
to sleep. I don't know how it is, I was engaged in an affair of this
nature once before, and never cared a pin about the matter; but
somehow I have got what they call a presentiment that harm will come of
to-morrow's business. I saw that man, Wilford, for a minute yesterday,
and I know by the expression of his eye that he means mischief; there
was such a look of fiendish triumph in his face when he found the
challenge was accepted&mdash;if ever there was a devil incarnate, he is one."
</p>
<p>
A sigh was my only answer, for his words were but the echo of my
forebodings.
</p>
<p>
"Now I will tell you what brought me here," he continued; "don't you
think that we ought to have a surgeon on the ground, in case of anything
going wrong?"
</p>
<p>
"To be sure," replied I; "I must have been mad to have forgotten that it
was necessary&mdash;what can be done?&mdash;it is not every man that would choose
to be mixed up with such an affair. Where is it that William Ellis's
brother (Ellis of Trinity Hall, you know) has settled?&mdash;he told me he
had purchased a practice somewhere in our neighbourhood."
</p>
<p>
"The very man, if we could but get him," replied Archer; "the name of
the village is Harley End; do you know such a place?"
</p>
<p>
"Yes," returned I, "I know it well; it is a favourite meet of the
hounds, about twelve miles hence. I'll find him, and bring him
here&mdash;what time is it? just two&mdash;if I could get a horse I would do it
easily."
</p>
<p>
"My tilbury and horse are up at the village," said <span class="pagenum">[214]</span>Archer; "now
Harry's horses are at home, they could not take mine in at the hall."
</p>
<p>
"The very thing," said I, "we shall not lose a moment in that case. Is
your horse fast? I shall have to try his mettle."
</p>
<p>
"He'll not fail you," was the reply, "but don't spare him&mdash;I would
rather you should ruin fifty horses than arrive too late."
</p>
<p>
On reaching the inn we had to rouse a drowsy hostler in order to procure
the key of the stables, and it was half-past two before I was able, to
start.
</p>
<p>
The road to Harley End was somewhat intricate, more than once I took a
wrong turning, and was forced to retrace my steps; being aware also of
the distance I had to perform, I did not dare to hurry the horse
too much, so that it only wanted a quarter to four when I reached my
destination. Here, however, fortune favoured me. Mr. Ellis, it appeared,
being an ardent disciple of Isaac Walton, had resolved to rise at
day-break in order to beguile sundry trout, and, at the entrance of the
village, I met him strolling along, rod in hand. Two minutes sufficed to
make him acquainted with the object of my mission, and in less than
five minutes more (a space of time which I employed in washing out
the horse's mouth at an opportune horse-trough, with which I took
the liberty of making free) he had provided himself with a case of
instruments and other necessary horrors, all of which he described to me
<i>seriatim</i>, as we returned, with an affectionate minuteness for which I
could have strangled him.
</p>
<p>
We started at a rattling pace on our homeward drive, hedgerow and fence
gliding by us like slides in a magic lantern. Archer's horse did not
belie the character he had given of him. With head erect, and expanded
nostril, he threw his legs forward in a long slashing trot, whirling the
light tilbury along at the rate of at least eleven miles an hour;
and fortunate it was that he did not flinch from his work, for we
had between thirteen and fourteen miles to perform in an hour and ten
minutes in order to reach the appointed spot by five o'clock. In our way
we had to pass within a quarter of a mile of Heathfield Hall; all seemed
quiet as we did so, and I heard the old clock over the stables strike a
quarter to five.
</p>
<p>
"We shall be in capital time," said I, drawing a long breath, as I felt
relieved from an anxious dread of being too late. "It was a near thing
though, and if I had not met you as I did, we should scarcely have done
it."
</p>
<p>
"Famous horse," replied Ellis; "but you've rather <span class="pagenum">[215]</span>over-driven him
the last two or three miles; if I were Archer, I should have a little
blood taken from him&mdash;nothing like venesection; it's safe practice in
such cases as the present. You've a remarkably clear head, Fairlegh, I
know; now I'll just explain to you the common sense of the thing: the
increased action of the heart forces the blood so rapidly through the
lungs, that proper time is not allowed for oxygenisation&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>
<p>
"We shall be in sight of the place when we have advanced another hundred
yards," interrupted I, as we turned down a green lane.
</p>
<p>
"Shall we?" replied my companion, standing up in the gig, and shading
his eyes with his hand. "Yes, I see them, they're on the ground already,
and, by Jove, they are placing their men; they must have altered the
time, for it wants full ten minutes of five now."
</p>
<p>
"If they have," replied I, lashing the horse into a gallop, as I
remembered that this unhappy change would probably frustrate Coleman's
scheme, "if they have, all is lost."
</p>
<p>
My companion gazed upon me with a look of surprise, but had no time to
ask for an explanation, for at that moment we reached the gate leading
into the field, around which was collected a group, consisting of a gig
and a dog-cart (which had conveyed the respective parties, and a servant
attendant upon each, to the ground), and two or three labouring men,
whom the unusual occurrence had caused to leave their work, and who were
eagerly watching the proceedings&mdash;whilst, just inside the gate, a boy,
whom I recognised as Wilford's tiger, was leading about a couple of
saddle-horses, one of them being the magnificent black thorough-bred
mare, of which mention has been already made.
</p>
<p>
Pulling up the horse with a jerk which threw him on his haunches, I
sprang out, and, placing my hand on the top rail of the gate, leaped
over it, gaining, as I did so, a full view of the antagonist parties,
who were stationed at about two hundred yards from the spot where I
alighted. Scarcely, however, had I taken a step or two towards the scene
of action when one of the seconds, Wentworth, I believe, dropped a white
handkerchief, and immediately the sharp report of a pistol rang in
my ear, followed instantaneously by a second. From the first moment
I caught sight of them my eyes had become riveted by a species of
fascination, which rendered it impossible to withdraw them, upon
Oaklands. As the handkerchief dropped I beheld him raise his arm, and
discharge his <span class="pagenum">[216]</span>pistol in the air, at the same moment he gave a
violent start, pressed his hand to his side, staggered blindly forward a
pace or two, then fell heavily to the ground (rolling partially over
as he did so), where he lay perfectly motionless, and to all appearance
dead.

">
</center>

<p>
On finding all my worst forebodings thus apparently realised, I stood
for a moment horror-stricken by the fearful sight I had witnessed. I
was first roused to a sense of the necessity for action by Ellis, the
surgeon, who shouted as he ran past me:&mdash;
</p>
<p>
"Come on, for God's sake, though I believe he's a dead man!"'
</p>
<p>
In another moment I was kneeling on the turf, assisting Archer (who
trembled so violently that he could scarcely retain his grasp) to raise
and support Oaklands' head.
</p>
<p>
"Leave him to me," said I; "I can hold him without assistance; you will
be of more use helping Ellis."
</p>
<p>
"Oh! he's dead&mdash;I tell you he is dead!" exclaimed Archer in a tone of
the most bitter anguish.
</p>
<p>
"He is no such thing, sir," returned Ellis angrily; "hand me that lint,
and don't make such a fuss; you're as bad as a woman."
</p>
<p>
Though slightly reassured by Ellis's speech, I confess that, as I looked
upon the motionless form I was supporting, I felt half inclined to fear
Archer might be correct in his supposition. Oaklands' head, as it rested
against me, seemed to lie a perfectly dead weight upon my shoulder; the
eyes were closed, the lips, partly separated, were rapidly assuming a
blue, livid tint, whilst from a small circular orifice on the left side
of the chest the life-blood was gushing with fearful rapidity.
</p>
<p>
"Open that case of instruments, and take out the tenaculum. No, no! not
that; here, give them to me, sir; the man will bleed to death while
you are fumbling," continued Ellis, snatching his instruments from the
trembling hands of Archer. "You are only in the way where you are," he
added; "fetch some cold water, and sprinkle his face; it will help to
revive him."
</p>
<p>
At this moment Wilford joined the group which was beginning to form
round us. He was dressed as usual in a closely-fitting suit of black,
the single-breasted frockcoat buttoned up to the neck, so as not to show
a single speck of white which might serve to direct his antagonist's
aim. He approached with his wonted air of haughty indifference, coolly
fastening the button of his glove. On perceiving me he slightly raised
his hat, saying:&mdash;
</p>
<p>
"You are resolved to see this matter to its conclusion, <span class="pagenum">[217]</span>then, Mr.
Fairlegh; no one can be better aware than you are how completely your
friend brought his fate upon himself".
</p>
<p>
He paused as if for an answer; but, as I remained silent, not being able
to trust myself to speak, he added, gazing sternly at the prostrate form
before him&mdash;"Thus perish all who dare to cross my path!" Then casting
a withering glance around, as he marked the indignant looks of the
by-standers, he turned on his heel and stalked slowly away.
</p>
<p>
"He'd best quicken his pace," observed one of the countrymen who had
joined the group, "for there's them a coming as may stop his getting
away quite so easy."
</p>
<p>
As he spoke the gate of the field was thrown open, and a couple of men
on horseback rode hastily in. Wilford, however, as soon as he perceived
their approach, made a sign to the boy to bring his horse, and,
springing lightly into the saddle, waited quietly till they came near
enough for him to recognise their faces, when, raising his voice, he
said in a tone of the most cutting sarcasm:&mdash;
</p>
<p>
"As I expected, I perceive it is to Mr. Cumberland's disinterested
attachment that I am indebted for this kind attempt to provide for my
safety; it so happens you are a quarter of an hour too late, sir. I have
the honour to wish you good-morning."
</p>
<p>
Thus saying, he turned his horse's head, and cantered across the field.
The man he had addressed, and in whom, though he was considerably
altered, I recognised the well-remembered features of Richard
Cumberland, paused, as if in doubt what to do; not so his companion,
however, who, shouting, "Come on, sir, we may nab him yet," drove the
spurs into the stout roadster he bestrode and galloped furiously after
him, an example which Cumberland, after a moment's hesitation, hastened
to follow, though at a more moderate rate. Wilford suffered the foremost
rider to come nearly up to him, and then, quickening his pace, led him
round the two sides of the field; but perceiving the gate was closed,
and that men had stationed themselves in front of it to prevent his
egress, he doubled upon his pursuers, and, putting the mare for the
first time to her full speed, galloped towards the opposite side of the
field, which was enclosed by a strong fence, consisting of a bank with
oak palings on the top and a wide ditch beyond. Slackening his pace as
he approached this obstacle, he held his horse cleverly together,
and, without a moment's hesitation, rode at it. The beautiful animal,
gathering her legs well under her, <span class="pagenum">[218]</span>faced it boldly, rose to the
rail, and, clearing it with the greatest ease, bounded lightly over the
ditch, and continued her course on the further side with unabated speed.
Apparently determined not to be outdone, his pursuer, whipping and
spurring with all his might, charged the fence at the same spot where
Wilford had cleared it; the consequence was his horse rushed against the
rail, striking his chest with so much violence as to throw himself
down, pitching his rider over his head into the ditch beyond, whence he
emerged, bespattered with mud, indeed, but otherwise uninjured. As he
reappeared his companion rode up to him, and, after conversing with
him earnestly for a minute or so, turned and left the field, without
exchanging a word with any other person.
</p>
<p>
During this transaction, which did not occupy one-fourth of the time
it has taken us to describe, Ellis had in a great measure succeeded in
staunching the flow of blood, and a slight shade of colour became again
visible in Oaklands' cheek.
</p>
<p>
"He will bear moving now," said Ellis quickly, "but you must find
something to lay him upon; take that gate off its hinges, some of
you fellows&mdash;that will answer the purpose capitally. Come, bestir
yourselves; every moment is of importance."
</p>
<p>
Thus urged, five or six sturdy labourers, who had been standing round,
gazing with countenances of rude but sincere commiseration on the
wounded man (for Harry's kind-heartedness and liberality made him
very popular amongst the tenantry), started off, and returned in an
incredibly short space of time with the gate; upon this were spread our
coats and waistcoats, so as to form a tolerably convenient couch, upon
which, under Ellis's direction, we lifted with the greatest caution the
still insensible form of Harry Oaklands.
</p>
<p>
"Now," exclaimed Ellis, "raise him very slowly on your shoulders, and
take care to step together, so as not to jolt him;&mdash;if the bleeding
should break out again, the whole College of Surgeons could not save
him. Where's the nearest house he can be taken to? He'll never last out
till we reach the Hall."
</p>
<p>
"Take him to our cottage," said I eagerly; "it is more than half a mile
nearer than the Hall."
</p>
<p>
"But your mother and sister?" asked Archer.
</p>
<p>
"Of course it will be a great shock to them," replied I; "but I know
them both well enough to feel sure they would not hesitate a moment when
Harry's life was in <span class="pagenum">[219]</span>the balance. Do you want me for anything, or
shall I go on and prepare them for your arrival?"
</p>
<p>
"Do so, by all means," replied Ellis; "but stay&mdash;have you a bedroom on
the ground-floor?"
</p>
<p>
"Yes," returned I, "my own."
</p>
<p>
"Get the bed-clothes open," continued Ellis, "so that we can put him in
at once; it will save me half an hour's time afterwards, and is a thing
which should always be thought of on these occasions."
</p>
<p>
"Anything else?" inquired I.
</p>
<p>
"Yes, send somebody for the nearest surgeon; two heads are better than
one," said Ellis.
</p>
<p>
Remembering, as I approached the cottage, that the window of my room
by which Archer and I had quitted it the previous night would be
unfastened, I determined I would enter there, and, proceeding to my
mother's door, call her up, and break the news as gently as the exigency
of the case would permit, leaving her to act by Fanny as she should
think best. Accordingly, I flung up the window, sprang in, and, throwing
myself on the nearest chair, sat for a moment, panting from the speed
at which I had come. As I did so, a timid knock was heard at the door. I
instinctively cried, "Come in!" and Fanny entered.
</p>
<p>
"I have been so anxious all night about what you told me yesterday, that
I could not sleep, so I thought I would come to see if you were up," she
commenced; then, for the first time remarking my breathless condition
and disordered dress, she exclaimed, "Good Heavens! are you ill?
you pant for breath, and your hands and the sleeves of your coat are
saturated with water&mdash;with&mdash;oh! it is blood; you are wounded!" she
cried, sinking in a chair, and turning as pale as ashes.
</p>
<p>
"Indeed, darling, you are alarming yourself unnecessarily; I am
perfectly uninjured," replied I soothingly.
</p>
<p>
"Something dreadful has happened!" she continued, fixing her eyes upon
me; "I read it in your face."
</p>
<p>
"An accident has occurred," I began; "Oaklands&mdash;&mdash;"
</p>
<p>
"Stop!" she exclaimed, interrupting me, "the two shots I heard but
now&mdash;his agitation&mdash;his strange manner yesterday&mdash;oh! I see it all; he
has been fighting a duel." She paused, pressed her hands upon her eyes,
as if to shut out some dreadful vision, and then asked, in a low, broken
voice, "Is he killed?"
</p>
<p>
"No," replied I, "on my word, on my honour, I assure you he is not;
the bleeding had ceased when I left him, which is a very favourable
symptom."
</p>
<p>
<span class="pagenum">[220]</span>Fanny sighed heavily, as if relieved from some unbearable weight,
and, after remaining silent for about a minute, she removed her hands
from her face, and said, in a calm tone of voice:&mdash;
</p>
<p>
"And now, what is to be done? can I be of any use?"
</p>
<p>
Astonished at the rapidity with which she had regained her self-control
and presence of mind after the violent emotion she had so recently
displayed, I replied:&mdash;
</p>
<p>
"Yes, love, you can, the Hall is too far off, and they are bringing him
here".
</p>
<p>
As I spoke these words she shuddered slightly, but seeing I was doubtful
whether to proceed, she said, "Go on, pray".
</p>
<p>
"Would you," I continued, "break this to my mother, and tell her I
believe&mdash;that is, I trust&mdash;there is no great danger&mdash;and&mdash;and&mdash;do that
first."
</p>
<p>
With a sad shake of the head, as if she mistrusted my attempt to
reassure her, she quitted the room, whilst I obeyed Ellis's instructions
by preparing the bed; after which I unclosed the hall-door, and,
despatching the gardener's boy to fetch the surgeon, stood anxiously
awaiting the arrival of the party. I had not done so many minutes when
the measured tramp of feet gave notice of their approach, and in another
instant they came in sight.

<pre>
          "Recovery, where art thou?

          Daughter of Heaven, where shall we seek thy help?"

          "Come thou and chase away
          Sorrow and Pain, the persecuting Powers,
          Who make the melancholy day so long,
          So long the anxious night."

          "I look for thy approach,
          O life-preserving Power! as one who strays
          Alone in darkness o'er the pathless marsh,
          Watches the dawn of day."
          &mdash;<i>Southey</i>.
</pre>
<p>
"ALL well so far," replied Ellis, in answer to my look of inquiry; "the
bleeding has ceased, and he is fast recovering consciousness. Where is
the room? We must get him into bed at once."
</p>
<p>
<span class="pagenum">[221]</span>When we had placed him in the bed Oaklands lay for a short space
with his eyelids closed, uttering a low groan at intervals; at length
the quiet appeared in some measure to restore him, and, slowly opening
his eyes, he gazed languidly around, asking in a low voice, "Where am
I?"
</p>
<p>
"Let me beg you not to speak, Mr. Oaklands," said Ellis; "your safety
depends upon your keeping silence; you are at the cottage of your friend
Fairlegh."
</p>
<p>
As he heard these words Harry perceived me standing near the bed, and
smiled faintly in token of recognition; then, making a sign for me to
stoop down to him, he whispered, "My father&mdash;you must break this to
him&mdash;go, Frank".
</p>
<p>
"This instant," replied I, and I turned to leave the room, beckoning to
Ellis, as I did so, to follow me. "Tell me the truth," exclaimed I, as
he closed the door behind him, "will he live or die?"
</p>
<p>
"It is too early in the business to pronounce a decided opinion," was
the answer; "nor can I venture as yet to do so; everything depends
upon the course the ball may have taken, and that, as soon as the
other surgeon arrives, we must endeavour to ascertain; all I can say at
present is, that I have seen worse cases recover. There is one thing,"
he added, "which may be a satisfaction for you to know&mdash;if you had not
brought me, or some one in my profession, to the ground, he would have
bled to death where he fell; no one but a surgeon could have stopped
that bleeding."
</p>
<p>
"If we had been too late I should never have forgiven myself, and we
very nearly were so," returned I. "I cannot understand how it was."
</p>
<p>
"I can explain it," said Archer, who now joined us. "You left me up
at the village, you remember, Fairlegh, when you started to fetch Mr.
Ellis; well, just as I was leaving it to return to the Hall, a boy
ran past me at the top of his speed, and began knocking at one of the
cottage doors hard by; surprised to see any one about at so early an
hour in the morning, I inquired what was the matter. 'Master's just had
word brought him that some gem'men is a going to fight a jewel at five
o'clock, and I be come to call the constable, for master to give him
a warrant to take 'em hup.' 'And who is your master?' questioned I.
'Justice Bumbleby,' was the answer. This was enough for me; I made the
best of my way to the Hall, woke Oaklands, who was sleeping as calmly as
a child, poor fellow! and he immediately sent his own <span class="pagenum">[222]</span>groom, the
lad who went with us to the field, to inform Wilford and his second of
what I had heard, and to propose that the meeting should take place a
quarter of an hour earlier than the time originally agreed on, to which
they willingly consented."
</p>
<p>
"This then," thought I, "is the reason why Coleman's scheme failed, and
Cumberland arrived too late;&mdash;well, one good thing is, it will clearly
prove that neither Archer nor Oaklands connived at the intended
interruption."
</p>
<p>
The deep, the agonising grief of Sir John Oaklands, on receiving from my
lips the account of his son's danger, was most painful to witness, and
I was obliged to yield to his desire to return with me to the cottage,
although Ellis had strictly forbidden his being allowed to see Harry,
lest the excitement should prove injurious to the patient in the
precarious state in which he lay. On my return I found the surgeon
of the neighbourhood, Mr. (or as he was more commonly styled Dr.)
Probehurt, had arrived, and that they were endeavouring to extract
the ball, which, after a long and painful operation, they succeeded
in doing. From the marks on the coat and waistcoat, it appeared that
Wilford had aimed straight for the heart; but his deadly intentions
had been providentially frustrated by the accident of Oaklands having a
half-crown piece in a small pocket in his waist-coat, against which
the ball had struck, and, glancing off, passed between two of the
ribs, finally lodging amongst the muscles immediately under the
shoulder-blade. The great effusion of blood had been occasioned by its
having divided one of the smaller arteries, which Ellis had succeeded in
securing on the spot. The wound was, therefore, a very severe one;
but it was impossible to pronounce upon the exact amount of danger at
present, as the course which the ball had taken trenched closely on
so many important organs, that time alone could show the extent of the
injury sustained. With this opinion, in which (strange to say) both
doctors agreed, we were fain to content ourselves, and we passed
the rest of the day in alternately watching by the wounded man and
attempting to comfort and support Sir John, whom we had the greatest
difficulty in keeping out of Harry's room, till Ellis asked him abruptly
"whether he wanted to murder his son?" after which nothing short of
force could have induced him to enter it. One of his first acts, having
consulted with Dr. Probehurt, who graciously approved of the measure,
was to enter into an arrangement with <span class="pagenum">[223]</span>Ellis, to induce him
to remain constantly with Harry till his health should be perfectly
re-established, if, indeed, that happy event was ever destined to
occur. As Sir John's liberality was unbounded, and Ellis's professional
prospects rather hazy&mdash;his practice at Harley End being chiefly confined
to the very poor, who went on the advice gratis system, and expected
to have medicine given them into the bargain&mdash;the negotiation was soon
concluded to the satisfaction of both parties.
</p>
<p>
Towards evening Harry became more restless; the pain of his wound
increased, and feverish symptoms began to make their appearance. As the
night advanced he grew delirious, and before morning was in a high state
of fever. For many days his life was despaired of. Ellis never left his
bedside, save to snatch an occasional hour's sleep on a sofa, when I
took his place. Sir Benjamin Brodie was summoned from town, and held a
consultation with Dr. Probehurt and Ellis.
</p>
<p>
Sir John's grief was something fearful to witness. Although naturally a
strong-minded man, this unlooked-for blow and the subsequent anxiety had
completely unnerved him. At times he would cry like a child; at others
he would sit for hours without opening his lips, his head resting
dejectedly on his hands, the image of despair: he could with difficulty
be prevailed upon to take sufficient nourishment for his support,
and appeared scarcely to notice anything that was going on. On these
occasions Fanny was the only person whose influence was of the slightest
avail; with her own hands she would prepare some delicacy of which
she knew he was fond, and when with a melancholy shake of the head he
rejected it, she would seat herself at his feet, and, taking his hand
within her own, whisper kind words of hope and consolation to him,
till the old man's heart was softened, and he could refuse her nothing.
Sometimes even this failed, and then she would begin singing in a low
sweet voice some plaintive simple air that he loved to hear, till the
tears would steal down his grief-worn cheeks, and, laying his hand upon
her fair young brow, he would bless her, and say that the God who was
about to take his noble son from him, had sent an angel to be a daughter
to him in his stead. And so the weary days wore on&mdash;still vibrating
between life and death, the strong man, his matchless powers now reduced
to the weakness of infancy, lay stretched upon the couch of suffering,
whence it appeared too probable he might never be removed, save to the
last sad resting-place of frail humanity&mdash;the grave.
</p>
<p>
<span class="pagenum">[224]</span>About the eighth day the ligature with which Ellis had tied
the artery came away, and the wound assumed a rather more favourable
appearance, but the fever remained unsubdued, and the delirium
continued. Each day which passed without improvement added to the length
of Dr. Probehurt's solemn visage, and I could see that in his own mind
he had little or no hope of the patient's recovery. Ellis was by far
the most sanguine of the party, and, whenever we urged our gloomy
forebodings upon him, invariably replied&mdash;"Yes, I know all that&mdash;it
would have killed' any other man, but it won't kill him. Wait a bit, and
you'll see."
</p>
<p>
A fortnight had now elapsed, and the continued burden of his grief began
to tell visibly upon Sir John. The ruddy hue of health faded from his
cheeks; his eyes grew dim with weeping, his hands shook, and his firm
manly step became feeble and uncertain; it seemed as if in that short
space of time he had grown ten years older. My mother also began to look
ill and harassed, and Fanny, though she still kept up wonderfully, and
was the life and soul of us all, waxed paler and thinner every day,
while, for my own part, I could neither eat, drink, nor sleep to any
efficient purpose, and divided my time between watching in the sick-room
and pacing up and down the garden, beyond the precincts of which I
never ventured, from a nervous dread lest anything might go wrong in my
absence.
</p>
<p>
On one occasion Ellis, completely wearied out, had thrown himself on
a sofa to snatch an hour's repose, while I took his place by Harry's
bedside. It was between two and three o clock in the morning, and the
first rays of early dawn, stealing in through the partially closed
shutters, and mingling with the faint glimmer of the night-lamp, threw a
pale and ghastly light over the surrounding objects, when I fancied that
I heard my name pronounced in a low, scarcely audible voice. I glanced
at Ellis, but his hard and regular breathing proved him to be sound
asleep. I next turned towards the bed where Harry lay, and, carefully
shading the lamp with my hand, advanced with noiseless step towards
it. As I approached I perceived the patient's eyes were open, and, oh,
happiness I once more animated by the mild light of reason.
</p>
<p>
"Harry," whispered I, "did you call? Do you know me?"
</p>
<p>
A faint smile passed across his pallid features as he replied in a voice
so weak and low, that I was obliged to <span class="pagenum">[225]</span>stoop my head almost to a
level with his lips, ere I could catch his words&mdash;"Know you, dear Frank!
why not?"
</p>
<p>
"Thank heaven," murmured I, "he is no longer delirious!"
</p>
<p>
As I again turned towards him, he endeavoured to stretch out his hand to
me, but his strength was unequal even to that slight exertion, and his
arm dropped heavily by his side; as it did so, he spoke again&mdash;"Frank,
what is all this? I cannot&mdash;I am very weak&mdash;very tired."
</p>
<p>
"Lie still, dear Harry, and do not try to talk&mdash;it may do you harm. You
have been very ill, but God in His mercy will soon, I trust, restore
you to health." I then crossed over to Ellis's sofa, and laid my hand
lightly upon his shoulder. "Oaklands is no longer delirious," said I,
as he started up; "he knows me, and has spoken to me."
</p>
<p>
"Is he?&mdash;does he?&mdash;has he?"&mdash;exclaimed Ellis in an eager whisper. "I
told you it would never kill him. Why didn't you call me before? but
it's always the way; if I do by any chance fall asleep once in a week,
there isn't another head properly so called in the whole house, they
might as well be chair nobs&mdash;Yes, I know," he continued, as I attempted
to get in a word of explanation, "if you couldn't wake me before it
happened, that doesn't prevent your giving me the medicine-chest now,
does it?"
</p>
<p>
I may as well take this opportunity of mentioning that Ellis, though in
the main one of the best-tempered fellows in the world, whenever he was
particularly interested or excited, became extremely cross and snappish,
and was certain at such times to scold every one who fell in his way,
without the slightest regard to age, sex, or station. However, it was
always over in two or three minutes, and I have seen him laugh till the
tears ran down his face, when the rude things he had said were repeated
to him afterwards. While he was staying with his brother at Cambridge,
it used to be a favourite amusement with some of the men to start a
subject which they knew would excite him, for the sake of "getting a
rise out of the doctor," as they termed it. But I am digressing.
</p>
<p>
The medicine Ellis gave Harry threw him into a heavy sleep, from which
he did not awake until late in the morning, when he appeared perfectly
conscious. The fever had in great measure abated, and on Dr. Probehurt's
arrival he was fain to confess a surprising improvement had taken place,
and that, if not positively out of danger, the patient was in a fair way
to become so. As for Ellis, he was exactly like one beside himself.
He ran all over the house&mdash;into bedrooms and all sorts of places where
<span class="pagenum">[226]</span>he had not the slightest business, shaking hands with every one,
and repeating, "I knew it&mdash;I knew it&mdash;I always told you so&mdash;it would
have killed any other man, but it couldn't kill him!"
</p>
<p>
Let us pass in silence over the first interview between Sir John
Oaklands and his son. There are some of the deeper feelings of our
nature, planted in our bosoms by the hand of God Himself, which, when
called forth to their fullest extent by the chances of life, reveal so
clearly their divine origin, that those who witness their display stand
reverently by, and, with throbbing hearts and averted eyes, bow the
head as in presence of some holy thing; and if such pure and sacred
influences shed their lustre over that meeting, and the old man wept
tears of deep and fervent thankfulness on the neck of the son whom
he had, as it were, received from the dead, far be it from us, with
sacrilegious hand, to remove the veil which shrouds the hallowed
mysteries of feeling.
</p>
<p>
From that day Oaklands began to amend slowly, and, at the end of another
week, even the cautious Dr. Probehurt declared all immediate danger
was over; for which admission, however, he took care fully to indemnify
himself, by detailing at length every possible evil which might accrue
for the future. The state of weakness to which Harry's once herculean
frame was reduced was melancholy to witness; for many days he was unable
to turn in his bed without assistance, and even when he began to recover
his strength, it was by very slow and lingering degrees. Utterly unable
to support himself, he was lifted from his bed to a sofa, and wheeled
into the drawing-room, where all our powers of entertainment were called
into requisition to relieve the monotony of such a state of existence.
In doing this, Fanny made herself pre-eminently useful; by a sort of
intuition she appeared to divine everything he could possibly want
before he asked for it, and contrived to have it waiting his pleasure
as if by magic; and yet it was done so quietly, that I believe Harry had
not a notion to whom he was indebted for the forestalment of his every
wish. Did his lips appear parched and dry from the low fever which still
hung about him&mdash;unobserved by any one, Fanny would glide out of
the room, and in another minute his servant would enter with a tray
containing jelly, lemonade, or some refreshment of a like nature; and
Harry would say, with a languid smile, that the fairies must have been
at work, for that Wilson had brought him the very thing he was wishing
for. As he grew stronger, and <span class="pagenum">[227]</span>required less attention, I yielded
to his request, and once more resumed my studies, reading doubly hard in
order to make up for lost time. The duel had taken place early in June,
but it was not until the latter end of August that the surgeons would
allow of their patient's removal to the Hall. Under Ellis's directions
a kind of litter was prepared, drawn by a stout Shetland pony, and
hung upon a complicated arrangement of springs, by which means all
possibility of jolting was avoided. With the assistance of this vehicle,
Harry was enabled to take short airings in the park, and, when it was
found that no ill effects ensued, a fine day was chosen, and Heathfield
Hall flung wide its ample gates to receive once more within its walls
the heir of that noble property. It was a glad day for every one&mdash;the
old servants shed mingled tears of joy and sorrow; of joy that their
young master had been spared to come among them again, and of sorrow
when they gazed on his pallid cheeks and long thin hands, and thought
of the amount of suffering that manly frame must have undergone ere it
could have become such a wreck of its former self.
</p>
<p>
After his return home Oaklands progressed very slowly; he so far
recovered as to walk about the house and garden with the assistance of
Ellis's arm; but the wound in his side still presented an unsatisfactory
appearance, and obstinately refused to heal. Ellis's skill and attention
were unparalleled; he took the greatest interest in the case, and though
he pretended that his zeal was entirely professional, yet it was clear
the fascination which Harry seemed unconsciously to exercise over every
one who became intimate with him, had subdued even the sturdy doctor,
and that he had conceived the strongest affection for his patient.
</p>
<p>
The only one of the party on whom the fatigue and anxiety appeared
to have produced any lasting effect was dear little Fanny, and she
continued to look much more pale and thin than I liked to see her. Her
spirits, also, seemed less gay and buoyant than usual, and when Sir John
and Harry left us, and she had no longer any motive for exertion, a
kind of languor came over her, producing a listless distaste for all her
former employments; and she would sit for hours poring over one of the
Italian poets, without exchanging a word with any one. In order, if
possible, to rouse her from this state of apathy, I used every means in
my power to interest and amuse her; but, unfortunately, my time was
now so fully occupied that I had little leisure to bestow upon her. I
<span class="pagenum">[228]</span>was to take my degree at the commencement of the new year; and,
as I had made up my mind to try for honours, I had not a moment to lose,
and read eight hours a day. The rest of my time was devoted to Sir John
and Harry (save an odd hour or two for a constitutional scamper with my
gun through the preserves to keep down the rabbits, or a gallop across
country to prevent the hunters from getting too fat), and our kind
friends were never so well pleased as when they could persuade us all
to come to them. My sister, however, seemed to prefer dreaming over her
book to the exertion of accompanying us to the Hall, and even when she
did so, appeared unequal to the labour of amusing Harry, and devoted
herself to the more easy task of pleasing Sir John, who, happy beyond
expression in the prospect of his son's recovery, was in the highest
good humour with everybody and everything. Becoming at length far from
satisfied about Fanny, I mentioned my uneasiness to my mother, who
comforted me by the assurance, that she considered it merely the natural
consequences of the fatigue and anxiety she had undergone, a sort of
reaction of the spirits, for which time and rest would prove the most
effectual cure.
</p>
<p>
And once again the leaves upon the trees grew brown, presenting, in
their varied richness, those exquisite shades of colouring that gladden
a painter's eye&mdash;and the swallows, those summer parasites, taking alarm
at the first sharp blast from the north, had departed to prosecute their
annual pursuit of sunshine under difficulties, leaving the honest
robin redbreast to renew his friendship with the race of men&mdash;when
I, dissatisfied and anxious about those I was leaving behind me, and
nervous in the highest degree as to the result of the struggle for
distinction in which I was about to engage, once more took up my abode
at Trinity.<span class="pagenum">[229]</span>

<h2>
    CHAPTER XXIX &mdash; THE STRUGGLE IN CHESTERTON MEADOW
</h2>
<pre>
          "Men
          Put forth their sons to seek preferment out.

          Some to the studious universities,
          For any or for all these exercises."

          "Stand, sir, and throw us that you have about you;
          If not, we'll make you sit, and rifle you."

          "A rescue! a rescue! Good people bring a rescue or two!"

          "Construe me, art thou a gentleman?   What is thy name?
          Discuss!"
          &mdash;<i>Shakspeare</i>.
</pre>
<p>
HAVING now no one to interfere with me, I determined to read as hard as
my powers, mental and bodily, would allow, so as to give my talents, be
they great or small, full scope, and endeavour to evince my gratitude to
my unknown benefactor in the only manner that lay open to me, <i>i.e.</i>, by
proving to him that his liberality had not been thrown away. As the
men began to come up, I took care to let it be generally known among my
friends that I was reading steadily and in earnest, with a view of going
out in honours; and when they became convinced that this was the case,
and that whenever I "sported oak" there was positively "no admittance,"
they left me to my fate, as one who, in the words of Lawless,
"having strayed from the paths of virtue and&mdash;eh!&mdash;what do you call it?
&mdash;jollity&mdash;had fallen a victim to the vice of mathematics&mdash;not a hope
of recovery&mdash;a regular case of hydrostatics on the brain&mdash;eh! don't you
see?"
</p>
<p>
Besides the regular college tutor, I secured the assistance of what, in
the slang of the day, we irreverently termed "a coach," which vehicle,
for the conveyance of heavy learning (from himself to his pupils),
consisted of a gentleman who, but few years older than those whom he
taught, possessed more practical knowledge, and a greater aptitude for
the highest scientific research, than it had ever before been my fate
to meet with combined in any one individual. Under his able tuition I
advanced rapidly, and reading men began to look upon me as a somewhat
formidable rival. Several of my opponents, however, were men of
first-rate talent, whose powers of mind, as I could not for a moment
disguise from myself, <span class="pagenum">[230]</span>were infinitely superior to my own, and with
whom my only chance of competing successfully would be by the exercise
of indefatigable perseverance and industry. Daylight, therefore (which
at this season did not make its appearance over early), found me book in
hand, and midnight saw me still seated at my desk&mdash;sometimes with a wet
towel bound round my head, to cool the throbbing of my heated brow; at
others, with a tea-pot of strong green tea by my side, to arouse and
stimulate my wearied faculties: conventional specifics, of which, by the
way, I very quickly discovered the fallacy.
</p>
<p>
A fear of completely knocking up, however, induced me to preserve some
little method in my madness. I laid down a rule to walk for a couple
of hours every day, and thus, although I grew pale and thin, no very
dangerous effects appeared likely to ensue from my exertions.
</p>
<p>
One evening, about a week before the examinations were to begin, I was
taking my usual constitutional after Hall; and, careless which way I
turned my steps, crossed the river at Moore's, and followed the footpath
which led over the fields to the village of Chesterton. There had been a
cattle fair at some place in the neighbourhood, which had drawn together
a number of disreputable characters, and, in the course of my walk, I
passed two or three parties of rather suspicious-looking men. Having
nothing valuable about me, however, I continued my walk. I had advanced
some half mile or more, when I was roused from my meditations by a cry
of "Thieves I thieves! help! hoy! thieves, I say!" accompanied by the
noise of blows. When these sounds first reached me I was close to a
hedge and stile, across which the footpath led, and from the farther
side of which the cries proceeded. It was growing dark, but there still
remained light enough to distinguish objects at a moderate distance. To
bound over the stile and cast my eyes around was the work of a moment,
nor was I much longer in taking part in an affray which was going on.
</p>
<p>
The person whose cries I had heard was a stout little man, respectably
dressed, who was defending himself vigorously with what seemed in the
twilight a club, but which turned out eventually to be an umbrella,
against the attacks of a tall, strapping fellow, in a rough frieze
coat, who was endeavouring to wrest his weapon from him. A still more
formidable adversary was, however, approaching in the shape of a second
ruffian, who had armed himself with a thick stake out of the hedge,
and was creeping cautiously up behind the shorter man, with <span class="pagenum">[231]</span>the
evident intention of knocking him on the head. I instantly determined to
frustrate his benevolent design, nor was there much time to lose, if
I wished my assistance to prove of much avail. Shouting, therefore, as
well to intimidate the scoundrels as to let the person attacked know
that there was succour at hand, I sprang upon the man who held the
cudgel, and, seizing his uplifted arm, succeeded in averting the
coming blow from the head of the intended victim, who, ignorant of the
impending danger, was making most furious thrusts at his assailant
with the point of his umbrella, a novel mode of attack, which seemed to
perplex and annoy that individual in no small degree.
</p>

">
</center>

<p>
I had, however, but little time allowed me to make observations, as the
fellow with whom I had interfered, as soon as he perceived that he had
only an unarmed man to deal with, appeared determined not to give up
his hopes of plunder without a struggle, and, freeing his wrist by a
powerful jerk, he aimed a blow at me with the bludgeon, which, had it
taken effect, would at once have ended all my anxieties, and
brought this veracious history to an abrupt and untimely conclusion.
Fortunately, however, for "my gentle public" and their humble servant, I
was able, by dodging on one side, to avoid the stroke; and, seeing that
matters had now become serious, I closed with him, and, after a short
but severe struggle, had the satisfaction of depositing him flat on his
back on the green sward. As he fell he dropped his stick, of which I
immediately possessed myself, and, planting my foot upon his chest
to prevent his rising, I turned to see how the other combatants were
getting on. Dame Fortune had not, in this instance, acted up to her
usual principle of favouring the brave, for the hero of the umbrella,
having struggled gallantly for the preservation of his property and
person, had apparently at length been overpowered, and, when I
turned towards him, was lying on the ground, while his assailant was
endeavouring to rifle his pockets, a matter which was rendered anything
but easy of accomplishment by reason of the energetic kicks and
struggles of the fallen warrior. It was clear that if I would not have
the unfortunate little man robbed before my very eyes, I must go to his
assistance. Giving, therefore, my prostrate foe a tap on the head with
the stake, by way of a hint to lie still, I advanced to the rescue with
uplifted weapon. No sooner did the rascal perceive my approach, than,
quitting the fallen man, he sprang up, and, without waiting to be
attacked, took to <span class="pagenum">[232]</span>his heels and ran off as fast as his legs would
carry him, an example which his companion, seeing the coast clear,
hastened to emulate.
</p>
<p>
My first act, as soon as the thieves had departed, was to assist the old
gentleman to rise. As soon as he was on his legs again he shook himself,
as if to ascertain that he was uninjured, and exclaimed:&mdash;
</p>
<p>
"Umph! they're gone, are they? the scoundrels, high time they should, I
think; where's my umbrella? umph! second I've lost this year&mdash;just like
me".
</p>
<p>
The voice, the manner, but, above all, the emphatic grunts and the
final self-accusing soliloquy, "just like me," could proceed but from
one person, my old Helmstone acquaintance, Mr. Frampton; though by what
strange chance he should be found wandering by owl-light in a meadow
near Cambridge passed my comprehension to conceive. Feeling secure from
the alteration which had taken place in me since I had last seen him&mdash;an
alteration rendered still more complete by my academical costume&mdash;that
he would be unable to recognise me, I determined to amuse myself a
little at his expense before I made myself known to him. In pursuance
of this plan I picked up his umbrella and handed it to him, saying in an
assumed voice as I did so, "Here is your umbrella, sir".
</p>
<p>
"Thank ye, young man, thank ye, cost five-and-twenty shillings last
Friday week; umph! might have got a cotton one for less than one quarter
the money, that would have done just as well to thump thieves with&mdash;a
fool and his money&mdash;just like me, umph!"
</p>
<p>
"I hope you are not injured by your fall, or by the rough treatment you
have been subjected to?" inquired I.
</p>
<p>
"Umph! injured?" was the reply; "I've got a great bump on the back
of my head, and burst all the buttons off my waistcoat&mdash;I don't know
whether you call that being injured; but I can tell you I got away from
the Thugs at Strangleabad without any such injuries: umph!"
</p>
<p>
"It was fortunate that I happened to come up just when I did," observed
I.
</p>
<p>
"Umph! glad you think so," was the answer; "if that stick had come down
upon your skull, as the blackguard meant it to do, you would not have
found it quite so fortunate, I've a notion. Umph! all the same, I'm much
obliged to you; I might have been robbed and murdered too, if it had
not been for you, young man, and if you'll walk home with me to
the 'Hoop'&mdash;there's a name for an inn!&mdash;I'll give you a couple of
sovereigns. <span class="pagenum">[233]</span>and that's more than you've earned before to-day, I'll
be bound&mdash;umph!"
</p>
<p>
"I shall be delighted to see you safe home, sir, but you will excuse my
declining your pecuniary offer, though I must plead guilty to the charge
of not having earned as much&mdash;I believe I might say, in my whole life
before."
</p>
<p>
"Umph! I see&mdash;a gentleman, eh? and I to offer him money&mdash;just like me&mdash;a
lord, or a duke, I shouldn't wonder&mdash;there are all sorts and sizes of
'em here, they tell me&mdash;ask him to dinner. Umph! perhaps you'll
do me the honour of dining with me, young man&mdash;my lord, I
mean&mdash;mulligatawny&mdash;cat smothered in rice, which they call
curry&mdash;kibobs, and kickshaws&mdash;the cook is not so bad for a white; but
you should go to India if you care about eating&mdash;that's the place for
cookery, sir."
</p>
<p>
"I shall have much pleasure in accepting your invitation," replied I,
"if you will allow me to run away directly after dinner: I am reading for
my degree, and time is precious with me just now."
</p>
<p>
"Umph! so it should be always. I see, now I come to look at you, you are
one of the cap-and-gown gentlemen." (Then came an aside&mdash;"Cap, indeed!
it's a fool's cap would fit one half of 'em best!") "Pray, may I ask
what college you belong to, Mr. &mdash;&mdash;?"
</p>
<p>
"Legh is my name, sir&mdash;Legh of Trinity."
</p>
<p>
"Umph! Trinity; just the man I wanted to get hold of. My name's
Frampton, Mr. Lee: they know me well at the India House, sir. When we've
had a bit of dinner, and washed this horrid fog out of our throats with
a few glasses of wine, I shall be glad to ask you a question or two.
Umph!"
</p>
<p>
"Any information it may be in my power to afford you," I began&mdash;&mdash;
</p>
<p>
"That'll do, sir, that'll do," was the reply. "Perhaps you won't
be quite so ready when you hear what it is I want." Then, in an
undertone&mdash;"Tell me a parcel of lies, most likely; I know how these
young scamps hang by one another, and think it high fun 'to do the
governor,' as they call it. Umph!"
</p>
<p>
On our arrival at the Hoop we were ushered into one of the best
sitting-rooms the inn afforded, where a blazing fire soon effaced
all traces of the wet-blanket-like fog in which we had been so lately
enveloped. I was shown into a comfortable dressing-room to get ready for
dinner, an opportunity of which I availed myself to render my appearance
as unlike what it had been in former days as circumstances would allow,
before again subjecting myself <span class="pagenum">[234]</span>to Mr. Framptqn's scrutiny. For
this purpose, I combed my hair back from my face as far as possible, and
brushed my whiskers&mdash;an acquisition of which I had only lately become
possessed&mdash;as prominently forward as the growth of the crop permitted. I
poked my shirt-collar entirely out of sight, and tied my black neckcloth
stiffly up under my chin, and finally buttoned my coat, so as to show
off the breadth of my chest and shoulders to the greatest advantage.
Thus accoutred, and drawing myself up to my full height, I hastened to
rejoin Mr. Frampton. My arrangements seemed thoroughly to have answered
their purpose, for he gazed at me without evincing the slightest symptom
of recognition. He shook me by the hand, however, and thanked me more
cordially than he had yet done for the assistance rendered him, and then
rang for dinner. The bill of fare embraced all the Asiatic luxuries he
had enumerated, to which, on the strength of having invited a guest,
sundry European dishes were added; and with appetites sharpened by our
recent adventures, we did full justice to the good cheer that was set
before us.

"I HOPE you feel no ill effects from your adventure, sir: you resisted
the fellow's attack most spiritedly, and would have beaten him off,
I believe, if you had possessed a more serviceable weapon than an
umbrella," observed I to Mr. Frampton, as we drew our chairs to the fire
after dinner.
</p>
<p>
"Umph! all right, sir, all right: a little stiff or so across the back,
but not so bad as the tiger at Bundleapoor. I'm not as young as I used
to be, and there's a difference between young men and old ones. Young
men are all whalebone and whipcord, and it's nothing but hopping,
skipping, and jumping with them all day long; when <span class="pagenum">[235]</span>you're turned
of sixty-five, sir, the whalebone gets stiff, the whipcord wears
out, the skip and jump take their departure, and the hop becomes an
involuntary accompaniment to the rheumatism&mdash;confound it! Umph!"
</p>
<p>
"You have been in India, I presume; I think I heard you refer to some
adventure with a tiger," returned I.
</p>
<p>
"I've been everywhere sir&mdash;north, south, east, and west. I ran away from
school at twelve years old, because the master chose to believe one of
the ushers rather than me, and flogged me for lying when I had spoken
the truth. I ran away, sir, and got aboard a ship that was bound for the
East Indies, and for five-and-forty years I never saw the white cliffs
of Old England; and, when I did return, I might as well have left it
alone, for all who knew and cared for me were dead and gone&mdash;all
dead and gone, dead and gone!" he repeated in a tone of sorrowful
earnestness. Then came an aside: "Umph! wonder what I told him that
for; something for him to go and make fun of with the other young
scapegraces, instead of minding their books:&mdash;just like me!"
</p>
<p>
"You must have seen many strange things, and met with various adventures
worthy of note, in the course of your wanderings," remarked I.
</p>
<p>
"I must have been a fool if I hadn't," was the answer. "P'rhaps you
think I was&mdash;umph! Young folks always think old ones fools, they say."
</p>
<p>
"Finish the adage, sir, that old folks know young ones to be so, and
then agree with me that it is a saying founded on prejudice, and at
variance with truth."
</p>
<p>
"Umph! strong words, young gentleman, strong words. I will agree with
you so far, that there are old fools as well as young ones&mdash;old fools,
who, in their worldly wisdom, stigmatise the generous impulses and warm
affections of youth as folly, who may yet live to regret the feelings
they have crushed, and the affections they have alienated, and find out
that the things which they deemed folly may prove in the end the truest
wisdom." Then came the soliloquy: "There I go again&mdash;just like me!
something else for him to laugh at; don't think he will, though&mdash;seems
a good lad&mdash;wish t'other boy may be like him&mdash;umph!" He paused for
a minute, and then observed abruptly, "Umph! about the tiger at
Bundleapoor. You call to-night's an adventure, sir: wonder what you'd
have said if you'd been there!"
</p>
<p>
"As I was not, would it be asking too great a favour, if I request you
to relate the anecdote?"
</p>
<p>
"Aye, boy, boy, I see you know how to come round an <span class="pagenum">[236]</span>old traveller:
set him gossiping about all the fine things he has seen and done in his
younger days, and you win his heart at once. Well, fill your glass, sir,
and we'll see about it," was the reply.
</p>
<p>
I obeyed, Mr. Frampton followed my example, and, after sipping his wine,
and grunting several times to clear his throat, began the following
recital:&mdash;
</p>
<p>
"Umph! ha! let me recollect. When I was a young shaver, having lived
in the world some twenty years or so, I was engaged as a sort of
supernumerary clerk in the house of Wilson and Brown at Calcutta; and,
having no one else who could be so easily spared, they determined to
despatch me on a business negotiation to one of the native princes,
about eight hundred miles up the country.
</p>
<p>
"I travelled with a party of the &mdash; Dragoons, commanded
by a Captain Slingsby, a man about five years older than myself, and
as good a fellow as ever lived. Well, somehow or other, he took a great
fancy to me, and nothing would do but that I should accompany him in all
his sporting expeditions&mdash;for I should tell you that he was a thorough
sportsman, and, I believe, entertained some wild notion that he should
be able to make one of me. One unfortunate morning he came into my tent,
and woke me out of a sound sleep into which I had fallen, after being
kept awake half the night by the most diabolical howls and screams that
ever were heard out of bedlam, expecting every minute to see some of the
performers step in to sup, not with, but upon, me.
</p>
<p>
"'Come, Frampton, wake up, man,' cried Slingsby; 'here's great and
glorious news.'
</p>
<p>
"'What is it?' said I&mdash;'have they found another hamper of ale among the
baggage?'
</p>
<p>
"'Ale! nonsense,' was the reply. 'A shikkaree (native hunter) has just
come into camp to say that a young bullock was carried off yesterday,
and is lying half eaten in the jungle about a mile from this place; so
at last, my boy, I shall have the pleasure of introducing you to a real
live tiger.'
</p>
<p>
"'Thank ye,' said I, 'you're very kind; but if it's at all inconvenient
to you this morning you can put it off: another day will do quite as
well for me&mdash;I'm not in the least hurry.'
</p>
<p>
"It was of no use, however; all I got for my pains was a poke in the
ribs, and an injunction to lose no time in getting ready.
</p>
<p>
"Before we had done breakfast the great man of the neighbourhood, Rajah
somebody or other, made his <span class="pagenum">[237]</span>appearance on his elephant, attended
by a train of tawnies, who were to undertake the agreeable duty of
beating. Not being considered fit to take care of myself&mdash;a melancholy
fact of which I was only too conscious&mdash;it was decreed that Slingsby and
I should occupy the same howdah. Accordingly, at the time appointed, we
mounted our elephant; and having a formidable array of guns handed up to
us, we started.
</p>
<p>
"As my companion, and, indeed, every one else concerned in the matter,
evidently considered it completely as a party of pleasure, and seemed
prepared to enjoy themselves to the utmost, I endeavoured to persuade
myself that I did so too; and, consoled by the reflection that if the
tiger had positively eaten half a bullock yesterday afternoon, it never
could be worth his while to scale our elephant, and run the risk of
being shot, for the sake of devouring me, I felt rather bold than
otherwise. After proceeding for some distance through the jungle, and
rousing, as it seemed to me, every beast that had come out of Noah's
Ark, except a tiger, our elephant, who had hitherto conducted himself
in a very quiet and gentlemanly manner, suddenly raised his trunk and
trumpeted several times&mdash;a sure sign, as the mahout informed us, that a
tiger was somewhere close at hand.
</p>
<p>
"'Now then, Frampton,' cried my companion, cocking his double-barrel,
'look out!'
</p>
<p>
"'For squalls,' returned I, finishing the sentence for him.&mdash;'Pray, is
there any particular part they like to be shot in? whereabouts shall I
aim?'
</p>
<p>
"'Wherever you can,' replied Slingsby; 'be ready&mdash;there he is, by
Jupiter!' and, as he spoke, the long grass about a hundred yards in
front of us was gently agitated, and I caught a glimpse of what appeared
a yellow and black streak, moving swiftly away in an opposite direction.
&mdash;'Tally ho!' shouted Slingsby, saluting the tiger with both barrels. An
angry roar proved that the shots had taken effect, and in another moment
a large tiger, lashing his sides with his tail and his eyes glaring with
rage, came bounding towards us.
</p>
<p>
"'Now what's to be done?' exclaimed I&mdash;'if you had but left him alone,
he was going away as quietly as possible.'
</p>
<p>
"Slingsby's only reply was a smile, and seizing another gun, he fired
again. On receiving this shot the tiger stopped for a moment, and then,
with a tremendous bound, sprang towards us, alighting at the foot of a
small tree not a yard from the elephant's head.
</p>
<p>
<span class="pagenum">[238]</span>"'That last shot crippled him,' said my companion, 'or we should
have had the pleasure of his nearer acquaintance&mdash;now for the <i>coup
de grâce</i>&mdash;fire away!' and as he spoke he leaned forward to take a
deliberate aim, when suddenly the front of the howdah gave way, and to
my horror Slingsby was precipitated over the elephant's head, into,
as it seemed to me, the very jaws of the tiger. A fierce growl and a
suppressed cry of agony proved that the monster had seized his prey;
and I had completely given up my friend for lost, when the elephant,
although greatly alarmed, being urged on by the mahout, took a step
forward, and, twisting his trunk round the top of the young tree, bent
it down across the loins of the tiger, thus forcing the tortured animal
to quit his hold, and affording Slingsby an opportunity of crawling
beyond the reach of its teeth and claws. Forgetting my own fears in the
imminence of my friend's danger, I only waited till I could get a shot
at the tiger without running the risk of hurting Slingsby, and then
fired both barrels at his head, and was lucky enough to wound it
mortally. The other sportsmen coming up at the moment, the brute
received its quietus, but poor Slingsby's arm was broken where the tiger
had seized it with its teeth, and his shoulders and chest were severely
lacerated by its claws, nor did he entirely recover the shock for many
months.{1} And this was my first introduction to a royal tiger, sir.
I saw many of 'em afterwards, during the time I spent in India, but I
can't say I ever had much liking for their society&mdash;umph!"
</p>
<p>
This anecdote brought others in its train&mdash;minutes flew by apace, the
wine grew low in the decanters, and it became apparent to me that if
I would not lose the whole evening, and go home with my brains
muddled beyond all possibility of reading, I must take my departure.
Accordingly, pulling out my watch, I reminded Mr. Frampton of my
previous stipulation to be allowed to run away as soon as dinner was
concluded, adding that I had already stayed longer than was altogether
prudent. The reply to this announcement was, "Umph! sit still, sir, sit
still; I'm going to ring for another bottle of port".
</p>
<pre>
     1 The main facts of the foregoing anecdote are taken from
     Capt. Mundy's very interesting <i>Pen and Pencil Sketches</i>.
</pre>
<p>
Finding, however, that I was determined, he gave up the point, adding:
"Umph! well, if you must go, you must, I suppose&mdash;though you might refuse
a worse offer;&mdash;but, if you really are anxious about your studies
and <span class="pagenum">[239]</span>wish to distinguish yourself, I won't be the man to hinder
you&mdash;it's few enough of 'em are like you here, I expect"; then, <i>sotto
voce</i>, "wish t'other young monkey might be". "You hinted before
dinner at some information I might be able to give you?" said I
interrogatively.
</p>
<p>
"Umph! did I?&mdash;aye, so I did&mdash;you see, Mr. Lee, there's a young fellow
at Trinity, about your age I should fancy, whom I used to know as a
boy,&mdash;and&mdash;he was a very good boy&mdash;and&mdash;and&mdash;his mother's a widow;
poor thing&mdash;a very nice boy, I may say, he was&mdash;and as I feel a sort of
interest about him I thought that you might, perhaps, give one an idea
of how he's going on&mdash;just a notion&mdash;you understand&mdash;umph!"
</p>
<p>
"Exactly, sir," returned I, "and what may be the name of your friend?"
</p>
<p>
"Frank Fairlegh," was the answer.
</p>
<p>
"You could not have applied to a better person," replied I. "Frank
Fairlegh!&mdash;why, he was one of my most intimate friends."
</p>
<p>
"<i>Was</i>&mdash;umph!"
</p>
<p>
"Why, yes, it's more was than is, certainly&mdash;for since I've been reading
hard, it's a positive fact that I've scarcely seen his face."
</p>
<p>
"That looks as if he wasn't over fond of reading, then, eh?&mdash;umph!"
</p>
<p>
"You may put that interpretation upon it, certainly," replied I, "but
mind, I don't say it's the true one. I consider it would not be right
in me to tell tales out of school; besides there's nothing to
tell&mdash;everybody knows Frank Fairlegh's a good fellow&mdash;ask Lawless&mdash;ask
Curtis."
</p>
<p>
"Umph! Lawless? what? that wild young scamp who goes tearing about the
country in a tandem, as if a gig with one horse wasn't dangerous enough,
without putting on a second to make the thing positively terrific?
he must be badly off for something to do, if he can find no better
amusement than trying how nearly he can break a fool's neck, without
doing it quite;&mdash;umph! Curtis&mdash;why, that's the name of the young
gentleman&mdash;very gentle&mdash;who, the landlord tells me, has just been
rusticated for insulting Dr. Doublechin, and fastening a muzzle and
chain on one of the men they call 'bull-dogs,' saying, forsooth, that
it wasn't safe to let such ferocious animals go about loose&mdash;nice
acquaintance Mr. Frank Fairlegh seems to choose, and you know the
quotation, '<i>Noscitur a sociis</i>'."
</p>
<p>
"Oh," replied I, "but he has others; I have seen him in company with Mr.
Wilford."
</p>
<p>
<span class="pagenum">[240]</span>"Wilford? the noted duellist, that scoundrel who has lately shot
the son of Sir John Oaklands, as fine a young man as ever I set eyes
upon?&mdash;for I have often seen him when I was living at Helmstone; if I
thought, sir, that Fairlegh was a friend of that man&mdash;I'd&mdash;I'd&mdash;well,
sir," he exclaimed, seeing my eyes fixed upon him with a degree of
interest I could not conceal, "it's nothing to you, I suppose, what I
may intend to do by Mr. Frank Fairlegh! I may be his grandfather for
anything you can tell to the contrary; and I may choose to cut him off
with a shilling, I imagine, without its affecting you in any way&mdash;umph?"
</p>
<p>
"Scarcely so, Mr. Frampton," replied I, turning away to hide an
irrepressible smile, "if it is in consequence of what I have told you
that you are angry with poor Frank."
</p>
<p>
"Angry, sir, angry"&mdash;was the answer&mdash;"I'm never angry&mdash;there's nothing
worth being angry about in this world. Do you take snuff, sir? I've some
that came from&mdash;Umph! eh!" he continued, fumbling in all his
pockets&mdash;"hope I haven't lost my box&mdash;given me by the Begum of
Cuddleakee&mdash;splendid woman&mdash;only complexion too strong of the
tawny&mdash;Umph! left it in the other room, I suppose&mdash;back in a moment,
sir&mdash;Umph! umph!" and, suiting the action to the word, he went out,
slamming the door behind him.
</p>
<p>
As the reader may suppose, I was equally surprised and pleased to find
that my old friend not only remembered our former intimacy, but felt so
warm an interest in my welfare as to have put himself quite in a rage on
hearing of my supposed delinquencies. Although it had been the means of
eliciting such strong indications of his continued regard for me, I felt
half sorry for the deception I had practised upon him&mdash;the only thing
that could be done now, however, was to make myself known to him without
delay, and his absence from the room enabled me to put in practice a
plan for doing so which I had had in my mind all along. Accordingly,
going up to the chimney-glass I shook my hair forward, so that it fell
in waving curls about my face and forehead&mdash;took the stiffener out of my
neckcloth and, knotting the latter closely round my throat, turned down
my shirt-collar, so as to resemble as nearly as possible the Byron-tie
of my boyhood&mdash;then unbuttoning and throwing open my coat I resumed my
seat, arranging the candles so as to throw the light full upon my face
as I did so. I had scarcely completed my arrangements when I heard
Mr. Frampton's footstep in <span class="pagenum">[241]</span>the passage, and in another moment he
entered the room. "All right, Mr. Lee, all right, sir; I found the box
in my other coat-pocket; I was afraid the thieves might have forestalled
me; but&mdash;Umph!&mdash;eh!&mdash;why?&mdash;who?" Catching sight of me as he spoke, he
stopped short, and, shading his eyes with his hand, gazed earnestly at
me, with a look half-bewildered, half-incredulous. Taking advantage of
his silence I inquired in my natural tone and manner whether he had seen
Dr. Mildman lately.
</p>
<p>
"Umph! eh! Dr. Mildman?" was the reply&mdash;"why it can't be&mdash;and yet
it is&mdash;the boy Frank Fairlegh himself! Oh! you young villain!" and
completely overcome by the sudden and unexpected nature of the surprise
he sank back into a chair, looking the picture of astonishment.
</p>
<p>
Springing to his side, and pressing his hand warmly between my own, I
exclaimed, "Forgive me for the trick I have played you, sir. I knew you
the moment I heard your voice, when I was helping you up to-night, and,
finding you did not recognise me, I could not resist the temptation of
preserving my incognito a little longer, and introducing myself as a
stranger."
</p>
<p>
"Oh! you young scapegrace," was the rejoinder, "if ever I forgive
you, I'll&mdash;umph!&mdash;that I will"&mdash;then changing his tone to one of much
feeling, he continued, "So you hadn't forgotten the old man then, Frank?
good boy, good boy".
</p>
<p>
I had seated myself on a stool at his feet, and as he spoke he patted my
head with his hand, as if I had been a favourite dog.
</p>
<p>
"And all the things you said against yourself were so many lies, I
suppose? Umph! you are no friend to the homicide Wilford?"
</p>
<p>
"True to the ear, but false to the sense, sir," replied I. "Harry
Oaklands is the dearest friend I have on earth; we love each other as
brothers&mdash;between the man whose hand was so lately raised to shed that
brother's blood, and myself, there can be little friendship&mdash;if I do not
positively hate him, it is only because I would not willingly hate any
one. Lawless was an old fellow-pupil of mine, and, though he has many
follies about him, is at bottom more kind-hearted and well-disposed than
people give him credit for; we still continue friends, therefore, but,
our habits and pursuits being essentially different, I see very little
of him&mdash;with Curtis I never exchanged half a dozen words in my life."
</p>
<p>
"Umph! I understand, I understand; and how is Harry Oaklands? better
again, eh?"
</p>
<p>
<span class="pagenum">[242]</span>The reply to this query led to my being obliged to give Mr.
Frampton a succinct account of the duel, and it was not till I explained
my intention of trying for honours, and made him comprehend the
necessity of my being fully prepared for the ensuing examination, that
he would hear of my departure; and, when at last he did allow me to
go, he insisted on accompanying me to the gate of Trinity, and made
me promise to let him see me as often as I was able during his stay in
Cambridge, where, he informed me, he proposed remaining till after the
degrees wore conferred.

<p>
THE week passed away like a dream, and with a beating heart and
throbbing pulse I went through the various examinations, and engaged
with my competitors in the struggle for honours. Anxious in the highest
degree as to the result of my labours, I scarcely ate, drank, or slept,
and, had the necessity for exertion been protracted much longer, my mind
could not have borne the continued strain, and I should probably have
had a brain fever. It was the eventful Friday morning on which the list
was to come out, and in the course of an hour or two my fate would be
known. Utterly worn out by a night which anxiety had rendered sleepless,
I had hastily swallowed a cup of tea, and, turning away from the
untasted eatables, flung myself, wrapped in a dressing-gown, on the
sofa. I had not, however, lain there above a quarter of an hour, when a
tap was heard at the door, and Mr. Frampton made his appearance, attired
as usual in the well-remembered blue coat, with brass buttons, drab
shorts, and gaiters, with the broad-brimmed hat, lined with green, fixed
sturdily on his head, as if it was not made to take off at any time.
</p>
<p>
<span class="pagenum">[243]</span>"Umph! found my way up, you see! Fellow you call the gyp wanted to
make me believe you were out&mdash;thought I looked too like a governor to
be let in, I suppose; but it wouldn't do, sir; old birds are not to be
caught with chaff; and he spoke with an air of such intense honesty that
I felt sure he was lying, and told him so.&mdash;Don't get up, boy, don't get
up; you look as jaded as a hunted antelope. Why, you've never touched
your breakfast; you'll kill yourself if you go on at this rate."
</p>
<p>
"It will not last much longer, sir," said I; "in about another hour or
so my fate will be known. The list comes out this morning. Some of my
friends were to call for me, and we were to make a party to go down to
the Senate House together, for there is sure to be a crowd; but I shall
let them go without me, for I'm in such a state of nervous anxiety that
I feel fit for nothing."
</p>
<p>
"Umph! I'll go with them, if they've no objection," returned Mr.
Frampton. "If I should happen to get knocked over in the scuffle, I
shall want somebody to pick me up again. I shall like to see how near
the tail of the list they stick your name, Frank&mdash;umph!"
</p>
<p>
At this moment the door was flung open, and Lawless, Archer, and one or
two more men of my acquaintance came tumbling over one another into the
room, laughing vociferously at some unknown jest. Owing to the shape of
the apartment, the place where Mr. Frampton had seated himself was not
easily to be seen as you entered, consequently none of them observed
him.
</p>
<p>
"Fairlegh, old boy!" began Archer&mdash;
</p>
<p>
"Eh! here's such a tremendous go!" broke in Lawless. "Where's the
smelling-bottle? Archer swears he has just seen the ghost of Noah's
great-grandfather, as he appeared when dressed in his Sunday clothes!"
</p>
<p>
"'Pon my word it's true, and what will you lay it's a lie?" sang Archer.
"Oh! if you had but seen him, Fairlegh; he looked like&mdash;hang me if I
know anything ugly enough to compare him to."
</p>
<p>
"Was he at all like me, sir?&mdash;umph!" inquired Mr. Frampton in his
gruffest tone, putting on the broad-brimmed hat, and rising slowly from
his seat as he spoke.
</p>
<p>
"The very apparition itself, by Jingo!" exclaimed Archer, starting back
in alarm, half real, half affected, thereby nearly overturning Lawless,
who was just behind him.
</p>
<p>
<span class="pagenum">[244]</span>"Hold hard there, young fellow; where are you jibbing to? You'll
smash my panels in a minute, if you don't look out&mdash;eh?&mdash;why surely
it's the old boy from Helmstone," continued Lawless aside; "Mr.
Frampton&mdash;sir, your most obedient."
</p>
<p>
"Same to you, sir," was the reply; "glad to see your spirits don't seem
likely to fail you, Mr. Lawless&mdash;laughing at me, all of 'em, impudent
young dogs&mdash;what's t'other one's name, Frank? the one that took me for a
ghost&mdash;umph!"
</p>
<p>
"Allow me to introduce you&mdash;Mr. Frampton, Mr. Archer, Mr. Green, Mr.
Lacy, Mr. Richards."
</p>
<p>
The individuals named delivered themselves of a series of nods and jerks
as I pronounced their various patronymics, and Mr. Frampton took off
his hat, and made a polite bow to each man separately; then turning to
Archer, he said:&mdash;
</p>
<p>
"Pray, sir, may I inquire when and how you became so intimate with
Noah's great-grandfather as to mistake me for him?&mdash;umph!"
</p>
<p>
"Well, sir," said Archer, who was evidently taken somewhat aback by this
direct appeal, "it is an affair&mdash;that is, a circumstance&mdash;what I mean to
say is&mdash;the thing, as you must see, was completely&mdash;in fact it was quite
by accident, and promiscuously, so to speak, that I mistook you for the
respectable antediluvian&mdash;I should say, for his ghost."
</p>
<p>
"Umph! don't think I look much like a ghost, either. Not that there are
such things in reality; all humbug, sir. A man goes and eats beef and
pudding enough for two, has the night-mare, fancies next morning he has
seen a ghost, and the first fool he tells it to believes him. Well, Mr.
Lawless, not made a ghost of yourself by breaking your neck out of that
Infernal Machine of yours yet. Get his ex-majesty Louis Philippe to go
out for a ride with you in that, and his life would be in greater danger
than all the Fieschis in France could ever put it in. Umph!"
</p>
<p>
"The horses are in first-rate condition," returned Lawless, "enough to
pull a fellow's arms off till they've done about ten miles; that takes
the steel out of them a bit, and then a child may guide them. Happy to
take you a drive, Mr. Frampton, any time that suits you&mdash;eh?"
</p>
<p>
"Thank ye, sir, when that time comes I'll let you know; but I hope
to live a few years longer yet, and therefore you'll excuse my not
accepting your kind offer. Besides, if Mr. Archer was to see the ghost
of Noah's great-grand-father <span class="pagenum">[245]</span>in a tandem, he'd never get over it."
Then came the aside: "Umph! had him there, the young jackanapes".
</p>
<p>
"Well, Fairlegh, are you coming with us?" asked Lacy; "the list must be
out by this time."
</p>
<p>
"No; 'pon my word I can't," replied I. "I'm good for nothing this
morning."
</p>
<p>
"Serve you right, too," said Lawless, "for refusing the second bowl of
punch last night. I told you no good would come of it, eh?"
</p>
<p>
"Positively we ought to be going," interposed Richards; "we'll bring you
some news presently, Fairlegh, that will set you all right again in no
time."
</p>
<p>
"I only wish you may prove a true prophet," replied I. "Umph! if you'll
allow me, I'll accompany you, gentlemen," said Mr. Frampton; "make one
of your party, umph!"
</p>
<p>
Several of those thus appealed to exchanged glances of horror, and at
last Archer, who was rather an exclusive, and particularly sensitive to
ridicule, began:&mdash;
</p>
<p>
"Why, really, sir, you must excuse&mdash;"
</p>
<p>
"Umph! excuse? no excuses are required, sir; when you've lived as long
as I have, you'll learn not to care in what company you sail, so as it's
honest company. Noah's great-grandfather found out the truth of
that, sir, when he had to be hail-fellow-well-met with tiger-cats and
hippopotamuses in the ark&mdash;hippopotami, I suppose you classical men call
it&mdash;though, now I come to think of it, he never was there at all. But
you will let an old man go with you, there's good boys," continued Mr.
Frampton in a tone of entreaty; "not one of you feels more interest in
Frank Fairlegh's success than I do."
</p>
<p>
"Come along, governor," exclaimed Lawless, taking him by the arm, "you
and I will go together, and if anybody gets in your way, down he goes if
he were as big as Goliath of Gath. You shall see the list as soon as any
one of them, for you're a trump&mdash;a regular brick!"
</p>
<p>
"With a very odd tile on the top of it," whispered Archer, pointing to
the broad brim.
</p>
<p>
"Now, then," continued Lawless, "fall in there. Follow the governor.
To the right about face! March!" So saying, he flung open the door, and
arm-in-arm with Mr. Frampton hurried down the stairs, followed by the
others in double-quick time. When they were all gone I made an effort to
rouse myself from the state of lassitude and depression into which I had
fallen, and <span class="pagenum">[246]</span>succeeded so far as to recover sufficient energy
to attempt the labour of dressing, though my hands trembled to such a
degree that I could scarcely accomplish it, and was forced to postpone
the operation of shaving to some more favourable opportunity.
</p>
<p>
Having made my outer-man respectable, I re-entered the sitting-room, and
waited with impatience for the return of my friends. Oh! the horrors of
suspense! that tooth-ache of the mind, in which each moment of anxiety r
stretched on the rack of expectation, appears to the overwrought senses
an eternity of gnawing anguish!&mdash;of all the mental tortures with which I
am acquainted, defend me from suspense!
</p>
<p>
I had worked myself up into a thorough fever, and was becoming so
excited that I was on the point of rushing out to learn the worst at
once, when sundry shouts, mingled with peals of laughter, reached my
ear&mdash;sounds which assured me that news was at hand. And now, with the
inconsistency of human nature, I trembled at, and would willingly have
delayed, my friends' arrival, lest it might bring me the certainty
of failure, to which even the doubt and suspense I had been so lately
chafing at appeared preferable. The sounds grew louder and louder&mdash;they
were approaching. Oh! how my heart beat! in another moment they would
be here. Sinking into a chair, for my knees trembled so that I could
scarcely stand, I remained with my eyes fixed upon the door in a state
of breathless anxiety. More shouting! surely that was a cheer&mdash;
</p>
<p>
"Hurrah! hurrah! out of the way there! room for the governor!"&mdash;a rush
of many feet up the stairs&mdash;more, cheering&mdash;the door is thrown open, and
a party of from fifteen to twenty undergraduates come pouring in, with
Mr. Frampton in the midst of them, carried in triumph on the shoulders
of Lawless and another man, and waving a list in one hand, and the
broad-brimmed hat in the other.
</p>

">
</center>

<p>
"Bravo, Fairlegh! all right, old fellow! never say die! hurrah!"
exclaimed half a score voices, all at once, while both my hands
were seized and nearly shaken off, and I was almost annihilated by
congratulatory slaps on the back from my zealous and excited friends.
</p>
<p>
"Well," exclaimed I, as soon as I could make myself audible amidst the
clamour, "I suppose by your congratulations I'm not plucked, but how
high do I stand?" "Silence there!" shouted Lawless. "Order! order! hear
the governor; he's got the list. Fire away, sir."
</p>
<p>
<span class="pagenum">[247]</span>Thus appealed to, Mr. Frampton, who was still mounted on the
shoulders of his supporters, having cleared his throat and grunted
proudly, with an air of majesty read as follows:&mdash;
</p>
<p>
"Kushbrooke, Senior Wrangler&mdash;Crosby, second&mdash;Barham, third&mdash;Fairlegh,
fourth!"
</p>
<p>
"Nonsense," exclaimed I, springing up, "the thing's impossible!"
</p>
<p>
"What an unbelieving Jew it is," said Archer; "hand him the list, and
let him read it himself. Seeing is believing, they say."
</p>
<p>
Yes, there it was, beyond all possibility of doubt; with my own eyes
did I behold it. "Fairlegh, fourth Wrangler!" Why, even in my wildest
moments of hope my imagination had never taken so high a flight. Fourth
Wrangler! oh! it was too delightful to be real. So overcome was I by
this unexpected stroke of good fortune, that for a minute or two I was
scarcely conscious of what was going on around me, and returned rambling
and incoherent answers to the congratulations which were showered upon
me. The first thing that roused my attention was a shout from Lawless,
demanding a hearing, for that "the governor," as he persisted in calling
Mr. Frampton, was going to make a speech. The cry was immediately taken
up by the others, who for some moments defeated their own purpose by
calling vociferously for "silence for the governor's speech!" Having
at length, from sheer want of breath, obtained the required boon, Mr.
Frampton, waving his hand with a dignified gesture, began as follows:&mdash;
</p>
<p>
"Umph! on this happy occasion, gentlemen&mdash;set of noisy young scamps!&mdash;on
this happy occasion, I say"&mdash;(shouts of encore! bravo! etc.)&mdash;"what I
was going to say was&mdash;umph!" (a cry of "You have said it," from a man
near the door, who thought he could not be seen, but was). "Much obliged
to you, sir, for your observation," continued Mr. Frampton, fixing his
glance unmistakably on the Detected One, "but I have not said it,
nor does it seem very likely I ever shall say it, if you continue to
interrupt me with your wretched attempts at wit." (Cries of "Hear!
hear! don't interrupt the governor! Shame! shame!" and an aside from
Mr. Frampton, "Had him there, umph!" during all of which the detected
individual was striving to open the door, which several men, who had
perceived his design, held firmly against him.) "What I was going to
say," resumed the speaker, "when that gentleman who is trying to leave
the room <span class="pagenum">[248]</span>interrupted me" (more cries of "Shame!"), "was, that I
beg, in the name of my friend, Frank Fairlegh, to invite you all to a
champagne breakfast in his rooms to-morrow," (tremendous cheering, and a
cry of "Bravo, governor! you are a brick!" from Lawless), "and in my own
name to thank you all, except the gentleman near the door, who has not
yet, I see, had the grace to leave the room, for the patience with
which you've listened to me," (laughter, and cries of "It was a shame to
interrupt him," at which the Detected One, with a frantic gesture,
gives up the door, and, turning very pale, glances insanely towards the
window), "and for the very flattering attentions which you have all
of you generally, and Mr. Archer in particular, done me the honour of
paying me."
</p>
<p>
A perfect tornado of cheers and laughter followed Mr. Frampton's speech,
after which I thanked them all for the kind interest they had expressed
in my success, and begged to second Mr. Frampton's invitation for the
following day. This matter being satisfactorily arranged, certain of
the party laid violent hands on the Detected One, who was a very shy
freshman of the name of Pilkington, and, despite his struggles, made him
go down on his knees and apologise in set phrase to Mr. Frampton for his
late unjustifiable conduct; whereupon that gentleman, who enjoyed the
joke, and entered into it with as much zest as the veriest pickle among
them, sternly, and with many grunts, rebuked and then pardoned him.
</p>
<p>
The champagne breakfast on the following morning who shall describe!
What pen, albeit accustomed to the highest nights imaginable, may
venture to depict the humours of that memorable entertainment! How,
when the company were assembled, it was discovered Mr. Pilkington was
missing, and a party, headed by Lawless, proceeded to his rooms, which
were on the same staircase, and brought him down, <i>vi et armis</i>, in
a state of mind bordering on distraction, picturesquely attired in
a dressing-gown, slippers, and smoking-cap, of a decidedly oriental
character; and how, when they had forced him into a seat of honour at
Mr. Frampton's right hand, that gentleman discovered in him a striking
likeness to his particular friend the Rajah of Bundleoragbag, which
name, being instantly adopted by the company, he was invariably
addressed by ever after. How, as the champagne circulated, the various
members of the party began to come out strong, according to their
several idiosyncrasies, every man who had a peculiarity exhibiting it
for the benefit of the others; while those who had not <span class="pagenum">[249]</span>were even
more amusing, either from their aping the manners of somebody else, or
from the sheer absurdity of uttering insipid commonplaces in such an
atmosphere of fun and frolic. How, later in the day, after healths had
been drunk, and thanks returned, till every one, save Pilkington, was
hoarse with shouting, that individual was partly coaxed, partly coerced
into attempting to sing the only song he knew, which proved to be, "We
met"; in which performance, after making four false starts, and causing
a great many more meetings to take place than the author of the song
ever contemplated, he contrived, in a voice suggestive of a sudden
attack of cholera, to get as far as the words, "For thou art the cause
of this anguish, my mother," when he was interrupted by such a chorus of
laughter as completely annihilated him for the rest of the day.

</center>

<p>
How Mr. Frampton, without giving the slightest warning of his intention,
or there being anything in the subject of the conversation generally
to lead thereunto, began to relate his adventure with the tiger of
Bundleapoor; while Lawless favoured the company with a full, true and
particular account of a surprising run with the royal stag-hounds; and
Archer, who had grown sentimental, with tears in his eyes, entered into
a minute detail of certain passages in a romantic attachment he had
conceived for a youthful female branch of the aristocracy, whom he
designated as Lady Barbara B.; and how these three gentlemen continued
their various recitals all at one and the same time, edifying the
company by some such composite style of dialogue as the following:&mdash;
</p>
<p>
"So, sir, Slingsby roused me by a kick in the ribs, saying
&mdash;umph!"&mdash;"Fairest, loveliest of thy sex,"&mdash;"Shove on your boots and
buckskins, stick a cigar in your mouth, and clap your leg over,"&mdash;"An
elephant half as high again as this room; take a couple of
double-barrelled rifles, and"&mdash;"Slap at everything that comes in your
way; no craning, ram in the persuaders, and if you do get a purl"&mdash;"Look
upon it as the purest, brightest gem in your noble father's coronet, for
true affection"&mdash;"Flung him clean into the tiger's jaws, sir, and the
beast"&mdash;"Drew her handkerchief across her eyes, and said, in a voice
which quivered with emotion, 'Love between two young creatures, situated
as we are, would be utter madness, Charles'. To which I replied,
'Barbara, my own sweet girl,'"&mdash;"Mind your eye, and look out for
squalls, for that's a rasper, and no mistake".
</p>
<p>
How all this took place, together with much more notable merriment, not
many degrees removed from "tipsy mirth and jollity," we will leave to
the fertile imagination of the reader to depict. Suffice it to say that,
ere we broke up, Mr. Frampton had distinctly pledged himself to ride one
of Lawless's horses the next hunting-day, and to accompany Archer on
a three weeks' visit to the country seat of Lady Barbara B.'s noble
father, with some ulterior views on his own account in regard to a
younger sister.<span class="pagenum">[250]</span>
